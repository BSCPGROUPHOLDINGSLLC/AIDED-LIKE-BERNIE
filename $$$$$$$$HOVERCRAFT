What does this mean for the Bureau’s healthcare costs?

In our review of the Bureau’s health care costs, we found that medical services comprised 88% or $1.2 billion
of the Bureau’s total health care obligations in 2016. The coronavirus could add to these costs.


For example, the Bureau will need to purchase additional equipment and supplies, such a masks, gloves, thermometers,
and ventilators. Total salaries and benefits expenditures could increase because Bureau medical staff may be needed 
to work overtime to screen for the virus and treat inmates. Further, outside medical care costs could 
increase if Bureau medical facilities are unable to manage the number of ill inmates and they must be sent 
to private physicians or hospital for care.

## BUDGET
https://www.gao.gov/blog/20-years-assessing-dods-weapon-programs-shows-importance-having-right-information-making-investment-decisions
DOD created an acquisition pathway for programs to aim to deliver capability within 5 years. Having the right information at program start can help decision makers determine whether delivering capability within 5 years is an achievable goal, although the information might not need to be as formal as for other programs.

For example, the Army’s Mobile Protected Firepower program—started in 2018 and billed as the next generation of infantry combat vehicles—completed prototype capability within 5 years. We found that this program benefited from completing analyses of its schedule and technology risks, among other key documents, before it started.

In contrast, the Air Force’s Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon program (a hypersonic missile program that aimed to delivery early capability in about 4 years) did not develop an acquisition strategy or assess technical and schedule risks before initiation. The program had an aggressive schedule, further strained by test failures. As a result, the planned program completion date has been delayed nearly a year.

Moving forward

With DOD’s planned investment in these weapon systems over $1.79 trillion in fiscal year 2021, programs attaining the right knowledge at the right time is more important than ever if they are to remain on schedule and within budget.
