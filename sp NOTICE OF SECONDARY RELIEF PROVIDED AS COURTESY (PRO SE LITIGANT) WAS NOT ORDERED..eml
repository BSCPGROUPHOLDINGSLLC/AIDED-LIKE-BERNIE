Title 18 - Crimes and Criminal Procedure
Part I: §1962 - §1963
§ 1962 - Prohibited activities
     (a) It shall be unlawful for any person who has received any income 
derived, directly or indirectly, from a pattern of racketeering activity 
or through collection of an unlawful debt in which such person has 
participated as a principal within the meaning of section 2, title 18, 
United States Code, to use or invest, directly or indirectly, any part 
of such income, or the proceeds of such income, in acquisition of any 
interest in, or the establishment or operation of, any enterprise which 
is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign 
commerce. A purchase of securities on the open market for purposes of 
investment, and without the intention of controlling or participating in 
the control of the issuer, or of assisting another to do so, shall not 
be unlawful under this subsection if the securities of the issuer held 
by the purchaser, the members of his immediate family, and his or their 
accomplices in any pattern or racketeering activity or the collection of 
an unlawful debt after such purchase do not amount in the aggregate to 
one percent of the outstanding securities of any one class, and do not 
confer, either in law or in fact, the power to elect one or more 
directors of the issuer.
     (b) It shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern of 
racketeering activity or through collection of an unlawful debt to 
acquire or maintain, directly or indirectly, any interest in or control 
of any enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of which 
affect, interstate or foreign commerce.
     (c) It shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated 
with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, 
interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or 
indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise's affairs through a 
pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.
     (d) It shall be unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any 
of the provisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section.

the counselors of Bernie Madoff? How do I go about insuring those assets 
of mine which have NOT been returned as of current? I will not pursue 
the FDIC for my money, however other may, as they have reported both 
vacancies and a growth +/- while considering the 10 years prior did 
represent YoY changes which do not represent a natural NNN-Lease, as 
those would be linear. About MY deposit: My Deposit is being held at a 
bank that is, per FDIC guidelines, holding unlawful assets in custody


- as none of the properties in LOAN 50074 to State Farm Bank, FSB<br>


  have NO certificate of occupancy.<br>

  Hence, my concern is not only what happens to my rent and security 
deposit being held on deposit illegally at JP Morgan Chase Bank, but how 
many other Loans does State Farm have that are undisclosed, 
notwithstanding the legal matter <br>

Hey it is Sunday, and as promised.
— that truth does hurt when the dust settles, I can hit three court 
houses in 30 States this quickly.

I promise.

They are not litigating anything in the county of Kings or New York “ONLY”….
—- without feeling “that vibe” of a different variety though, not “that 
vibe” when the bad guys are after you, the other vibe..  But still a 
vibe, like that vibrant photograph that gets faxed with the header.

           “CEASE AND DESIST”

“Can’t find him… hah” they eventually are going to want to sue someone 
or file with the SEC and give up another client for immediate 
“heightened supervision” upon filing.

You think they will add that to their engagement letters for a retainer 
though, to provide disclosure to their clients of what they are up against?

So, I promised…

Despite the breach USC code 18.2, 18.3, 18.4, 18.21, 18.215, 18.225 - do 
the counselors of Sullivan Properties also get charged concurrent 
sentences like the counselors of Bernie Madoff? How do I go about 
insuring those assets of mine which have NOT been returned as of 
current? I will not pursue the FDIC for my money, however other may, as 
they have reported both vacancies and a growth +/- while considering the 
10 years prior did represent YoY changes which do not represent a 
natural NNN-Lease, as those would be linear. About MY deposit: My 
Deposit is being held at a bank that is, per FDIC guidelines, holding 
unlawful assets in custody


- as none of the properties in LOAN 50074 to State Farm Bank, FSB<br>

commerce. A purchase of securities on the open market for purposes of 
investment, and without the intention of controlling or participating in 
the control of the issuer, or of assisting another to do so, shall not

§1963. Criminal penalties
<p>

(a) Whoever violates any provision of section 1962 of this chapter shall 
be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years (or for 
life if the violation is based on a racketeering activity for which the

derives profits or other proceeds from an offense may be fined not more 
than twice the gross profits or other proceeds.
(b) Property subject to criminal forfeiture under this section includes-

### USC 18. §208. Acts affecting a personal financial interest


(a) Except as permitted by subsection (b) hereof, whoever, being an 
officer or employee of the executive branch of the United States 
Government, or of any independent agency of the United States, a Federal 
Reserve bank director, officer, or employee, or an officer or employee 
of the District of Columbia, including a special Government employee, 
participates personally and substantially as a Government officer or 
employee, through decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, the 
rendering of advice, investigation, or otherwise, in a judicial or other 
proceeding, application, request for a ruling or other determination, 
contract, claim, controversy, charge, accusation, arrest, or other 
particular matter in which, to his knowledge, he, his spouse, minor 
child, general partner, organization in which he is serving as officer, 
director, trustee, general partner or employee, or any person or 
organization with whom he is negotiating or has any arrangement 
concerning prospective employment, has a financial interest-Shall be 
subject to the penalties set forth in section 216 of this title.
(b) Subsection (a) shall not apply-
(1) if the officer or employee first advises the Government official 
responsible for appointment to his or her position of the nature and 
circumstances of the judicial or other proceeding, application, request 
for a ruling or other determination, contract, claim, controversy, 
charge, accusation, arrest, or other particular matter and makes full 
disclosure of the financial interest and receives in advance a written 
determination made by such official that the interest is not so 
substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity of the 
services which the Government may expect from such officer or employee;
(2) if, by regulation issued by the Director of the Office of Government 
Ethics, applicable to all or a portion of all officers and employees 
covered by this section, and published in the Federal Register, the 
financial interest has been exempted from the requirements of subsection 
(a) as being too remote or too inconsequential to affect the integrity 
of the services of the Government officers or employees to which such 
regulation applies;
(3) in the case of a special Government employee serving on an advisory 
committee within the meaning of the Federal Advisory Committee Act 
(including an individual being considered for an appointment to such a 
position), the official responsible for the employee's appointment, 
after review of the financial disclosure report filed by the individual 
pursuant to the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, certifies in writing 
that the need for the individual's services outweighs the potential for 
a conflict of interest created by the financial interest involved...

Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act permits the Commission to sanction

specified in Section 203(e)(2) within ten years of the commencement of 
proceedings. 15 U.S.C. § 80b3(e)(2),(f).

15 U.S.C. § 80b3(e)(2)(A).
Ex. C at 1-2; Exs. D, E. The superseding indictment charged Balboa with, 
among other things, engaging in a scheme to falsely inflate the value of 
illiquid securities between January 2008 and October 2008 and with

15 U.S. Code § 78r - Liability for misleading statements
(a)Persons liable; persons entitled to recover; defense of good faith; 
suit at law or in equity; costs, etc.
Any person who shall make or cause to be made any statement in any 
application, report, or document filed pursuant to this chapter or any 
rule or regulation thereunder or any undertaking contained in a 
registration statement as provided in subsection (d) of section 78o of 
this title, which statement was at the time and in the light of the 
circumstances under which it was made false or misleading with respect 
to any material fact, shall be liable to any person (not knowing that 
such statement was false or misleading) who, in reliance upon such 
statement, shall have purchased or sold a security at a price which was 
affected by such statement, for damages caused by such reliance, unless 
the person sued shall prove that he acted in good faith and had no 
knowledge that such statement was false or misleading. A person seeking 
to enforce such liability may sue at law or in equity in any court of 
competent jurisdiction. In any such suit the court may, in its 
discretion, require an undertaking for the payment of the costs of such 
suit, and assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, 
against either party litigant.

(b)Contribution
Every person who becomes liable to make payment under this section may 
recover contribution as in cases of contract from any person who, if 
joined in the original suit, would have been liable to make the same 
payment.

(c)Period of limitations
No action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under 
this section unless brought within one year after the discovery of the 
facts constituting the cause of action and within three years after such 
cause of action accrued.


[SFITX]
15 U.S. Code § 78s - Registration, responsibilities, and oversight of 
self-regulatory organizations
(5)The Commission shall consult with and consider the views of the 
Secretary of the Treasury prior to approving a proposed rule filed by a 
registered securities association that primarily concerns conduct 
related to transactions in government securities, except where the 
Commission determines that an emergency exists requiring expeditious or 
summary action and publishes its reasons therefor. If the Secretary of 
the Treasury comments in writing to the Commission on a proposed rule 
that has been published for comment, the Commission shall respond in 
writing to such written comment before approving the proposed rule. If 
the Secretary of the Treasury determines, and notifies the Commission, 
that such rule, if implemented, would, or as applied does (i) adversely 
affect the liquidity or efficiency of the market for government 
securities; or (ii) impose any burden on competition not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section, the 
Commission shall, prior to adopting the proposed rule, find that such 
rule is necessary and appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this 
section notwithstanding the Secretary’s determination.

[t]he proper functioning of the securities industry and markets depends 
on the
integrity of industry participants and their commitment to transparent 
disclosure.
Securities industry participation by persons with a history of 
fraudulent conduct is
antithetical to the protection of investors. . . . We have long held 
that a history of
egregious fraudulent conduct demonstrates unfitness for future 
participation in the
securities industry even if the disqualifying conduct is not related to the
professional capacity in which the respondent was acting when he or she 
engaged
in the misconduct underlying the proceeding. The industry relies on the 
fairness
and integrity of all persons associated with each of the professions 
covered by the
collateral bar to forgo opportunities to defraud and abuse other market
participants.



TRANSACTIONS OF CERTAIN AFFILIATED PERSONS AND UNDERWRITERS
-UNLAWFUL TRANSACTIONS
SEC. 17. (a)
It shall be unlawful for any affiliated person or pro- moter of or 
principal underwriter for a registered investment company (other than a 
company of the character described in section 12 (d) (3) (A) and (B)), 
or any affiliated person of such a person, promoter, or principal 
underwriter, acting as principal-
(1) knowingly to sell any security or other property to such registered 
company or to any company controlled by such regis- tered company, 
unless such sale involves solely (A) securities of which the buyer is 
the issuer, (B) securities of which the seller is the issuer and which 
are part of a general offering to the holders of a class of its 
securities, or (C) securities deposited with the trustee of a unit 
investment trust or periodic payment plan by the depositor thereof;

(2) knowingly to purchase from such registered company, or from any 
company controlled by such registered company, any security or other 
property (except securities of which the seller is the issuer)


Liability of directors, etc., for willful misfeasance.
SEC. 17.
(h)     After one year from the effective date of this title, neither
the charter, certificate of incorporation, articles of association, 
indenture of trust, nor the by-laws of any registered investment 
company, nor any other instrument pursuant to which such a company is 
organized or administered, shall contain any provision which protects or 
purports to protect any director or officer of such company against any 
liability to the company or to its security holders to which he would 
otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross 
negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct 
of his office.

         In the event that any such instrument does not at the effective 
date of this Act comply with the requirements of this subsection (h) and 
is not amended to comply therewith prior to the expiration of said one 
year, such company may nevertheless continue to be a registered 
investment company and shall not be deemed to violate this subsection if 
prior to said expiration date each such director or officer shall have 
filed with the Commission a waiver in writing of any protective 
provision of the instrument to the extent that it does not comply with 
this subsection, and each such person subsequently elected or appointed 
shall before assuming office file a similar waiver.

(i)     After one year from the effective date of this title no contract 
or agreement under which any person undertakes to act as investment 
adviser of, or principal underwriter for, a registered investment 
company shall contain any provision which protects or purports to 
protect such person against any liability to such company or its 
security holders to which he would otherwise be subject by reason of 
willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence, in the performance 
of his duties, or by reason of his reckless disregard of his obligations 
and duties under such contract or agreement.

Injunctions against gross abuse.
SEC. 36.
The Commission is authorized to bring an action in the proper district 
court of the United States or United States court of
any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United 
States, alleging that a person serving or acting in one or more of the 
following capacities has been guilty, after the enactment of this title 
and within five years of the commencement of the action, of gross 
misconduct or gross abuse of trust in respect of any registered 
investment company for which such person so serves or acts:
(1) as officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment 
adviser, or depositor; or
(2) as principal underwriter, if such registered company is an open-end 
company, unit investment trust, or face-amount
certificate company.
If the Commission's allegations of such gross misconduct or gross abuse 
of trust are established, the court shall enjoin such person from acting 
in such capacity or capacities either permanently or for such period of 
time as it in its discretion shall deem appropriate.


SEC. 32.
(c) The Commission is authorized, by rules and regulations or order in 
the public interest or for the protection of investors, to require 
accountants and auditors to keep reports, work sheets, and other 
documents and papers relating to registered investment companies for 
such period or periods as the Commission may prescribe, and to make the 
same available for inspection by the Commission or any member or 
representative thereof.


DESTRUCTION AND FALSIFICATION OF REPORTS AND RECORDS
SEC. 34.

(a) It shall be unlawful for any person, except as permitted by rule, 
regulation, or order of the Commission, willfully to
destroy, mutilate, or alter any account, book, or other document the 
preservation of which has been required pursuant to section 31 (a) or 32 
(c).
(b) It shall be unlawful for any person to make any untrue statement of 
a material fact in any registration statement, application, report, 
account, record, or other document filed or transmitted pursuant to this 
title or the keeping of which is required pursuant to section 31 (a).

It shall be unlawful for any person so filing, transmitting, or keeping 
any such document to omit to state therein any fact necessary in order 
to prevent the statements made therein, in the light of the 
circumstances under which they were made, from being materially 
misleading. For the purposes of this subsection, any part of any such 
document which is signed or certified by an accountant or auditor in his 
capacity as such shall be deemed to be made, filed, transmitted, or kept 
by such accountant or auditor, as well as by the person filing, 
transmitting, or keeping the complete document.

26 U.S. Code § 6662 - Imposition of accuracy-related penalty on 
underpayments

§ 1.6662-2 Accuracy-related penalty.
(a) In general. Section 6662(a) imposes an accuracy-related penalty on 
any portion of an underpayment of tax (as defined in section 6664(a) and 
§ 1.6664-2) required to be shown on a return if such portion is 
attributable to one or more of the following types of misconduct:

(1) Negligence or disregard of rules or regulations (see § 1.6662-3);

(2) Any substantial understatement of income tax (see § 1.6662-4); or

(3) Any substantial (or gross) valuation misstatement under chapter 1 
(“substantial valuation misstatement” or “gross valuation 
misstatement”), provided the applicable dollar limitation set forth in 
section 6662(e)(2) is satisfied (see § 1.6662-5).


(b) Amount of penalty -

(1) In general. The amount of the accuracy-related penalty is 20 percent 
of the portion of an underpayment
of tax required to be shown on a return that is attributable to any of 
the types of misconduct listed in paragraphs
(a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section, except as provided in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section.

(2) Increase in penalty for gross valuation misstatement.
In the case of a gross valuation misstatement, as defined in section 
6662(h)(2) and § 1.6662-5(e)(2),
the amount of the accuracy-related penalty is 40 percent of the portion 
of an underpayment of tax required
to be shown on a return that is attributable to the gross valuation 
misstatement, provided the applicable
dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2) is satisfied.



§ 1.6662-5 Substantial and gross valuation misstatements under chapter 1.
(a) In general. If any portion of an underpayment, as defined in section 
6664(a) and
§ 1.6664-2, of any income tax imposed under chapter 1 of subtitle A of 
the Code that is
required to be shown on a return is attributable to a substantial 
valuation misstatement
under chapter 1 (“substantial valuation misstatement”), there is added 
to the tax an amount equal to 20 percent of such portion.

Section 6662(h) increases the penalty to 40 percent in the case of a 
gross valuation misstatement under chapter 1
(“gross valuation misstatement”).
No penalty under section 6662(b)(3) is imposed, however, on a portion of 
an underpayment
that is attributable to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement 
unless the aggregate
of all portions of the underpayment attributable to substantial or gross 
valuation misstatements
exceeds the applicable dollar limitation ($5,000 or $10,000), as 
provided in section 6662(e)(2) and paragraphs
(b) and
(f)(2) of this section.
This penalty also does not apply to the extent that the reasonable cause 
and good faith exception to this penalty
set forth in § 1.6664-4 applies. There is no disclosure exception to 
this penalty.

(b) Dollar limitation.
No penalty may be imposed under section 6662(b)(3) for a taxable year unless

the portion of the underpayment for that year that is attributable to 
substantial or gross valuation misstatements exceeds $5,000
($10,000 in the case of a corporation other than an S corporation (as 
defined in section 1361(a)(1));

or a personal holding company (as defined in section 542)).

This limitation is applied separately to each taxable year for which 
there is a substantial or gross valuation misstatement.



(e) Definitions -

(1) Substantial valuation misstatement.
There is a substantial valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted 
basis of any property claimed on a
return of tax imposed under chapter 1 is 200 percent or more of the 
correct amount.

(2) Gross valuation misstatement.
There is a gross valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted basis 
of any property claimed on a return of tax
imposed under chapter 1 is 400 percent or more of the correct amount.

(3) Property.
For purposes of this section, the term “property” refers to both 
tangible and intangible property.
Tangible property includes property such as land, buildings, fixtures 
and inventory.
Intangible property includes property such as goodwill, covenants not to 
compete, leaseholds, patents,
contract rights, debts and choses in action.


(f) Multiple valuation misstatements on a return -

(1) Determination of whether valuation misstatements are substantial or 
gross.
The determination of whether there is a substantial or gross valuation 
misstatement on a return is
made on a property-by-property basis. Assume, for example, that property 
A has a value of 60 but a taxpayer claims a value of 110,
and that property B has a value of 40 but the taxpayer claims a value of 
100.

Because the claimed and correct values are compared on a 
property-by-property basis,
there is a substantial valuation misstatement with respect to property 
B, but not with respect to property A,
even though the claimed values (210) are 200 percent or more of the 
correct values (100) when compared on an aggregate basis.

(2) Application of dollar limitation. For purposes of applying the 
dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2),
the determination of the portion of an underpayment that is attributable 
to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement
is made by aggregating all portions of the underpayment attributable to 
substantial or gross valuation misstatements.

Assume, for example, that the value claimed for property C on a return 
is 250 percent of the correct value, and that the value claimed for 
property D on the return is 400 percent of the correct value.
Because the portions of an underpayment that are attributable to a 
substantial or gross valuation misstatement on a return are aggregated 
in applying the dollar limitation, the dollar limitation is satisfied if 
the portion of the underpayment that is attributable to the misstatement 
of the value of property C, when aggregated with the portion of the 
underpayment that is attributable to the misstatement of the value of 
property D, exceeds $5,000 ($10,000 in the case of most corporations).

(g) Property with a value or adjusted basis of zero.

The value or adjusted basis claimed on a return of any property with a 
correct value or adjusted basis of zero is considered to be 400 percent 
or more of the correct amount. There is a gross valuation misstatement 
with respect to such property, therefore, and the applicable penalty 
rate is 40 percent.

HOW TO VALUE A PROPERTY WITH LEGAL INCOME = $0.00

(e) Definitions -

(1) Substantial valuation misstatement.
There is a substantial valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted 
basis of any property claimed on a
return of tax imposed under chapter 1 is 200 percent or more of the 
correct amount.

(2) Gross valuation misstatement.
There is a gross valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted basis 
of any property claimed on a return of tax
imposed under chapter 1 is 400 percent or more of the correct amount.

(3) Property.
For purposes of this section, the term “property” refers to both 
tangible and intangible property.
Tangible property includes property such as land, buildings, fixtures

Intangible property includes property such as goodwill, covenants not to

(f) Multiple valuation misstatements on a return -

(1) Determination of whether valuation misstatements are substantial or 
gross.
The determination of whether there is a substantial or gross valuation 
misstatement on a return is
made on a property-by-property basis. Assume, for example, that property 
A has a value of 60 but a taxpayer claims a value of 110,

(2) Application of dollar limitation. For purposes of applying the

the determination of the portion of an underpayment that is attributable

Because the portions of an underpayment that are attributable to a 
substantial or gross valuation misstatement on a return are aggregated 
in applying the dollar limitation, the dollar limitation is satisfied if 
the portion of the underpayment that is attributable to the misstatement 
of the value of property C, when aggregated with the portion of the 
underpayment that is attributable to the misstatement of the value of 
property D, exceeds $5,000 ($10,000 in the case of most corporations).

(g) Property with a value or adjusted basis of zero.

The value or adjusted basis claimed on a return of any property with a 
correct value or adjusted basis of zero is considered to be 400 percent 
or more of the correct amount. There is a gross valuation misstatement 
with respect to such property, therefore, and the applicable penalty 
rate is 40 percent.

Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act permits the Commission to sanction 
any person who, at the time of the misconduct, was associated with an 
investment adviser, if the Commission finds that the sanction is in the 
public interest and the person has been convicted of any offense 
specified in Section 203(e)(2) within ten years of the commencement of 
proceedings. 15 U.S.C. § 80b3(e)(2),(f).

On June 23, 2014, Balboa was sentenced to a prison term of fortyeight 
months, to run concurrently on all counts, followed by three years of 
supervised release, and ordered to pay restitution of $390,243,873.92 
and to forfeit $2,223,000.

15 U.S.C. § 80b3(e)(2)(A).
Ex. C at 1-2; Exs. D, E. The superseding indictment charged Balboa with, 
among other things, engaging in a scheme to falsely inflate the value of 
illiquid securities between January 2008 and October 2008 and with 
committing wire fraud.

15 U.S. Code § 78r - Liability for misleading statements
(a)Persons liable; persons entitled to recover; defense of good faith; 
suit at law or in equity; costs, etc.
Any person who shall make or cause to be made any statement in any 
application, report, or document filed pursuant to this chapter or any 
rule or regulation thereunder or any undertaking contained in a 
registration statement as provided in subsection (d) of section 78o of 
this title, which statement was at the time and in the light of the 
circumstances under which it was made false or misleading with respect 
to any material fact, shall be liable to any person (not knowing that 
such statement was false or misleading) who, in reliance upon such 
statement, shall have purchased or sold a security at a price which was 
affected by such statement, for damages caused by such reliance, unless 
the person sued shall prove that he acted in good faith and had no 
knowledge that such statement was false or misleading. A person seeking 
to enforce such liability may sue at law or in equity in any court of 
competent jurisdiction. In any such suit the court may, in its 
discretion, require an undertaking for the payment of the costs of such 
suit, and assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, 
against either party litigant.

(b)Contribution
Every person who becomes liable to make payment under this section may 
recover contribution as in cases of contract from any person who, if 
joined in the original suit, would have been liable to make the same 
payment.

(c)Period of limitations
No action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under 
this section unless brought within one year after the discovery of the 
facts constituting the cause of action and within three years after such 
cause of action accrued.


[SFITX]
15 U.S. Code § 78s - Registration, responsibilities, and oversight of 
self-regulatory organizations
(5)The Commission shall consult with and consider the views of the 
Secretary of the Treasury prior to approving a proposed rule filed by a 
registered securities association that primarily concerns conduct 
related to transactions in government securities, except where the 
Commission determines that an emergency exists requiring expeditious or 
summary action and publishes its reasons therefor. If the Secretary of 
the Treasury comments in writing to the Commission on a proposed rule 
that has been published for comment, the Commission shall respond in 
writing to such written comment before approving the proposed rule. If 
the Secretary of the Treasury determines, and notifies the Commission, 
that such rule, if implemented, would, or as applied does (i) adversely 
affect the liquidity or efficiency of the market for government 
securities; or (ii) impose any burden on competition not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section, the 
Commission shall, prior to adopting the proposed rule, find that such 
rule is necessary and appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this 
section notwithstanding the Secretary’s determination.

[t]he proper functioning of the securities industry and markets depends 
on the
integrity of industry participants and their commitment to transparent 
disclosure.
Securities industry participation by persons with a history of 
fraudulent conduct is
antithetical to the protection of investors. . . . We have long held 
that a history of
egregious fraudulent conduct demonstrates unfitness for future 
participation in the
securities industry even if the disqualifying conduct is not related to the
professional capacity in which the respondent was acting when he or she 
engaged
in the misconduct underlying the proceeding. The industry relies on the 
fairness
and integrity of all persons associated with each of the professions 
covered by the
collateral bar to forgo opportunities to defraud and abuse other market
participants.

TRANSACTIONS OF CERTAIN AFFILIATED PERSONS AND UNDERWRITERS
-UNLAWFUL TRANSACTIONS
SEC. 17. (a)
It shall be unlawful for any affiliated person or pro- moter of or 
principal underwriter for a registered investment company (other than a 
company of the character described in section 12 (d) (3) (A) and (B)), 
or any affiliated person of such a person, promoter, or principal 
underwriter, acting as principal-
(1) knowingly to sell any security or other property to such registered 
company or to any company controlled by such regis- tered company, 
unless such sale involves solely (A) securities of which the buyer is 
the issuer, (B) securities of which the seller is the issuer and which 
are part of a general offering to the holders of a class of its 
securities, or (C) securities deposited with the trustee of a unit 
investment trust or periodic payment plan by the depositor thereof;

(2) knowingly to purchase from such registered company, or from any 
company controlled by such registered company, any security or other 
property (except securities of which the seller is the issuer)


Liability of directors, etc., for willful misfeasance.
SEC. 17.
(h)     After one year from the effective date of this title, neither
the charter, certificate of incorporation, articles of association, 
indenture of trust, nor the by-laws of any registered investment 
company, nor any other instrument pursuant to which such a company is 
organized or administered, shall contain any provision which protects or 
purports to protect any director or officer of such company against any 
liability to the company or to its security holders to which he would 
otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross 
negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct 
of his office.

         In the event that any such instrument does not at the effective 
date of this Act comply with the requirements of this subsection (h) and 
is not amended to comply therewith prior to the expiration of said one 
year, such company may nevertheless continue to be a registered 
investment company and shall not be deemed to violate this subsection if 
prior to said expiration date each such director or officer shall have 
filed with the Commission a waiver in writing of any protective 
provision of the instrument to the extent that it does not comply with 
this subsection, and each such person subsequently elected or appointed 
shall before assuming office file a similar waiver.

(i)     After one year from the effective date of this title no contract 
or agreement under which any person undertakes to act as investment 
adviser of, or principal underwriter for, a registered investment 
company shall contain any provision which protects or purports to 
protect such person against any liability to such company or its 
security holders to which he would otherwise be subject by reason of 
willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence, in the performance 
of his duties, or by reason of his reckless disregard of his obligations 
and duties under such contract or agreement.

Injunctions against gross abuse.
SEC. 36.
The Commission is authorized to bring an action in the proper district 
court of the United States or United States court of
any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United 
States, alleging that a person serving or acting in one or more of the 
following capacities has been guilty, after the enactment of this title 
and within five years of the commencement of the action, of gross 
misconduct or gross abuse of trust in respect of any registered 
investment company for which such person so serves or acts:
(1) as officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment 
adviser, or depositor; or
(2) as principal underwriter, if such registered company is an open-end 
company, unit investment trust, or face-amount
certificate company.
If the Commission's allegations of such gross misconduct or gross abuse 
of trust are established, the court shall enjoin such person from acting 
in such capacity or capacities either permanently or for such period of 
time as it in its discretion shall deem appropriate.


SEC. 32.
(c) The Commission is authorized, by rules and regulations or order in 
the public interest or for the protection of investors, to require 
accountants and auditors to keep reports, work sheets, and other 
documents and papers relating to registered investment companies for 
such period or periods as the Commission may prescribe, and to make the 
same available for inspection by the Commission or any member or 
representative thereof.


DESTRUCTION AND FALSIFICATION OF REPORTS AND RECORDS
SEC. 34.

(a) It shall be unlawful for any person, except as permitted by rule, 
regulation, or order of the Commission, willfully to
destroy, mutilate, or alter any account, book, or other document the 
preservation of which has been required pursuant to section 31 (a) or 32 
(c).
(b) It shall be unlawful for any person to make any untrue statement of 
a material fact in any registration statement, application, report, 
account, record, or other document filed or transmitted pursuant to this 
title or the keeping of which is required pursuant to section 31 (a).

It shall be unlawful for any person so filing, transmitting, or keeping 
any such document to omit to state therein any fact necessary in order 
to prevent the statements made therein, in the light of the 
circumstances under which they were made, from being materially 
misleading. For the purposes of this subsection, any part of any such 
document which is signed or certified by an accountant or auditor in his 
capacity as such shall be deemed to be made, filed, transmitted, or kept 
by such accountant or auditor, as well as by the person filing, 
transmitting, or keeping the complete document.

LEAST ONE OF THESE IDIOTS WOULD WRITE BACK ?

- THEY MUST BE AT THE COMMUNITY BOARD , MY BAD... I'LL JUST LET THEM 
STEAL MY MONEY AS WELL, THEY ONLY STOLE ABOUT $500,000,000.00 IN TAX 
DOLLARS FROM FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL FUNDS..


-- CARRIES INTEREST DAILY.

#GOCARDS, I ANNEXED THEIR "OUT" IN THE CHANGE TO CAPTION WITHIN THE 
90-DAY WINDOW. - INSTEAD, OBSTRUCTION WAS A PREFERRED METHOD.

- I WAS NOT PERMITTED TO FILE A MOTION, ONLY EXHIBITS.
ALL SIX PROPERTIES BACK 10-YEARS PLUS.
- KNOWN BY THEIR REPRESENTATIVES AS WELL... ALL OF THEM WELL VERSED

UNTIL THEY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THE TRUTH.
 > THAT'S TWO YEARS CARRIED INTEREST... BUT OWED BY STATE FARM 
IMMEDIATELY AND WILL BE "REIUMBURSED" BY THE ZUCKER FAMILY.

GOOD LUCK

USC 18, § 373 - Solicitation to commit a crime of violence

(a) Whoever, with intent that another person engage in conduct 
constituting a felony that has as an element the use, attempted use, or 
threatened use of physical force against property or against the person 
of another in violation of the laws of the United States, and under 
circumstances strongly corroborative of that intent, solicits, commands,

(b) It is an affirmative defence to a prosecution under this section 
that, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete 
renunciation of his criminal intent, the defendant prevented the 
commission of the crime solicited. A renunciation is not "voluntary and 
complete" if it is motivated in whole or in part by a decision to 
postpone the commission of the crime until another time or to substitute 
another victim or another but similar objective. If the defendant raises 
the affirmative defence at trial, the defendant has the burden of 
proving the defence by a preponderance of the evidence.
     (c) It is not a defence to a prosecution under this section that 
the person solicited could not be convicted of the crime because he 
lacked the state of mind required for its commission, because he was 
incompetent or irresponsible, or because he is immune from prosecution 
or is not subject to prosecution.

§21. Stolen or counterfeit nature of property for certain crimes defined
     (a) Wherever in this title it is an element of an offense that-

taken, altered, counterfeited, falsely made, forged, or obliterated; and
         (2) the defendant knew that the property was of such character;

stolen, converted, taken, altered, counterfeited, falsely made, forged, 
or obliterated.
             -(b) For purposes of this section, the term "official

States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its

an offense against the United States, is punishable as a principal.

     §3. - Accessory after the fact Whoever, knowing that an offense 
against the United States has been committed, receives, relieves, 
comforts or assists the offender in order to hinder or prevent his 
apprehension, trial or punishment, is an accessory after the fact.

                     (18) THE ZUCKER ORGANIZATION LLC
USC 18, § 373 - Solicitation to commit a crime of violence

(a) Whoever, with intent that another person engage in conduct 
constituting a felony that has as an element the use, attempted use, or 
threatened use of physical force against property or against the person 
of another in violation of the laws of the United States, and under 
circumstances strongly corroborative of that intent, solicits, commands, 
induces, or otherwise endeavours to persuade such other person to engage 
in such conduct, shall be imprisoned not more than one-half the maximum 
term of imprisonment or (notwithstanding section 3571) fined not more

                 (15)    <voicemail attached>

(b) It is an affirmative defence to a prosecution under this section 
that, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete 
renunciation of his criminal intent, the defendant prevented the 
commission of the crime solicited. A renunciation is not "voluntary and 
complete" if it is motivated in whole or in part by a decision to 
postpone the commission of the crime until another time or to substitute 
another victim or another but similar objective. If the defendant raises 
the affirmative defence at trial, the defendant has the burden of 
proving the defence by a preponderance of the evidence.
     (c) It is not a defence to a prosecution under this section that 
the person solicited could not be convicted of the crime because he 
lacked the state of mind required for its commission, because he was 
incompetent or irresponsible, or because he is immune from prosecution 
or is not subject to prosecution.
USC 18 [ FORFEITURES ] >> RISKS HELD UNDER STATE FARM AT THE OBSTRUCTION 
OF THE COUNSELORS IN NYSCEF 153974/2020

§229B. Criminal forfeitures; destruction of weapons
     (a) Property Subject to Criminal Forfeiture.
     -Any person convicted under section 229A(a) shall forfeit to the 
United States irrespective of any provision of State law-
         (1) any property, real or personal, owned, possessed, or used 
by a person involved in the offense;
         (2) any property constituting, or derived from, and proceeds 
the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of such 
violation; and
         (3) any of the property used in any manner or part, to commit, 
or to facilitate the commission of, such violation.

     The court, in imposing sentence on such person, shall order, in 
addition to any other sentence imposed pursuant to section 229A(a), that 
the person forfeit to the United States all property described in this 
subsection. In lieu of a fine otherwise authorized by section 229A(a), a 
defendant who derived profits or other proceeds from an offense may be 
fined not more than twice the gross profits or other proceeds.
     (b) Procedures.-
         (1) General.
         -Property subject to forfeiture under this section, any seizure 
and disposition thereof, and any administrative or judicial proceeding 
in relation thereto, shall be governed by subsections (b) through (p) of 
section 413 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act 
of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853), except that any reference under those 
subsections to-
             (A) "this subchapter or subchapter II" shall be deemed to 
be a reference to section 229A(a); and
             (B) "subsection (a)" shall be deemed to be a reference to 
subsection (a) of this section.
         (2) Temporary restraining orders.-
             (A)     In general.-For the purposes of forfeiture 
proceedings under this section, a temporary restraining order may be 
entered upon application of the United States without notice or 
opportunity for a hearing when an information or indictment has not yet 
been filed with respect to the property, if, in addition to the 
circumstances described in section 413(e)(2) of the Comprehensive Drug 
Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2)), the 
United States demonstrates that there is probable cause to believe that 
the property with respect to which the order is sought would, in the 
event of conviction, be subject to forfeiture under this section and 
exigent circumstances exist that place the life or health of any person 
in danger.
             (B)     Warrant of seizure.-If the court enters a temporary 
restraining order under this paragraph, it shall also issue a warrant 
authorizing the seizure of such property.
             (C)     Applicable procedures.-The procedures and time 
limits applicable to temporary restraining orders under section 
413(e)(2) and (3) of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control 
Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2) and (3)) shall apply to temporary 
restraining orders under this paragraph.
     (c) Affirmative Defense.
         -It is an affirmative defense against a forfeiture under 
subsection (b) that the property-
         (1) is for a purpose not prohibited under the Chemical Weapons 
Convention; and
         (2) is of a type and quantity that under the circumstances is 
consistent with that purpose.
     (d) Destruction or Other Disposition.-The Attorney General shall 
provide for the destruction or other appropriate disposition of any 
chemical weapon seized and forfeited pursuant to this section.
     (e) Assistance.
     (f) Owner Liability.
         -The owner or possessor of any property seized under this 
section shall be liable to the United States for any expenses incurred 
incident to the seizure, including any expenses relating to the 
handling, storage, transportation, and destruction or other disposition 
of the seized property

under regulations prescribed by him, the head of any department or 
agency involved, may declare void and rescind any contract, loan, grant, 
subsidy, license, right, permit, franchise, use, authority, privilege, 
benefit, certificate, ruling, decision, opinion, or rate schedule 
awarded, granted, paid, furnished, or published, or the performance of 
any service or transfer or delivery of any thing to, by or for any 
agency of the United States or officer or employee of the United States 
or person acting on behalf thereof, in relation to which there has been 
a final conviction for any violation of this chapter, and the United 
States shall be entitled to recover in addition to any penalty 
prescribed by law or in a contract the amount expended or the thing 
transferred or delivered on its behalf, or the reasonable value thereof.

208, or 209 of this title is the following:
         (1) Whoever engages in the conduct constituting the offense 
shall be imprisoned for not more than one year or fined in the amount 
set forth in this title, or both.
         (2) Whoever willfully engages in the conduct constituting the

     (b)     The Attorney General may bring a civil action in the 
appropriate United States district court against any person who engages 
in conduct constituting an offense under section 203, 204, 205, 207, 
208, or 209 of this title and, upon proof of such conduct by a 
preponderance of the evidence, such person shall be subject to a civil 
penalty of not more than $50,000 for each violation or the amount of 
compensation which the person received or offered for the prohibited 
conduct, whichever amount is greater. The imposition of a civil penalty 
under this subsection does not preclude any other criminal or civil 
statutory, common law, or administrative remedy, which is available by 
law to the United States or any other person.
     (c) If the Attorney General has reason to believe that a person is 
engaging in conduct constituting an offense under section 203, 204, 205, 
207, 208, or 209 of this title, the Attorney General may petition an 
appropriate United States district court for an order prohibiting that 
person from engaging in such conduct. The court may issue an order 
prohibiting that person from engaging in such conduct if the court finds 
that the conduct constitutes such an offense. The filing of a petition 
under this section does not preclude any other remedy which is available 
by law to the United States or any other person.

Reserve bank director, officer, or employee, or an officer or employee 
of the District of Columbia, including a special Government employee,

employee, through decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, the 
rendering of advice, investigation, or otherwise, in a judicial or other 
proceeding, application, request for a ruling or other determination,

matter and makes full disclosure of the financial interest and receives 
in advance a written determination made by such official that the 
interest is not so substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the 
integrity of the services which the Government may expect from such 
officer or employee;

Government Ethics, applicable to all or a portion of all officers and 
employees covered by this section, and published in the Federal

a conflict of interest created by the financial interest involved; or

particular matter involved is that resulting solely from the interest of 
the officer or employee, or his or her spouse or minor child, in

exemption under subsection (b)(1) or (b)(3) shall be made available to 
the public by the agency granting the exemption pursuant to the

describing each financial interest shall be no more extensive than that 
required of the individual in his or her financial disclosure report 
under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978.

Attorney General, shall issue uniform regulations for the issuance of

Hey it is Sunday, and as promised.
— that truth does hurt when the dust settles, I can hit three court 
houses in 30 States this quickly.

I promise.

They are not litigating anything in the county of Kings or New York “ONLY”….
—- without feeling “that vibe” of a different variety though, not “that 
vibe” when the bad guys are after you, the other vibe..  But still a 
vibe, like that vibrant photograph that gets faxed with the header.

           “CEASE AND DESIST”

“Can’t find him… hah” they eventually are going to want to sue someone 
or file with the SEC and give up another client for immediate 
“heightened supervision” upon filing.

You think they will add that to their engagement letters for a retainer 
though, to provide disclosure to their clients of what they are up against?

So, I promised…

Thank you for understanding and responding to these unusual proceedings 
and during the COVID-19 pandemic decided to Violate my Privacy and my 
home, perverted and self-proclaimed landlords most likely have more 
items which need be reviewed in their thought process ( as in evaluated 
) to avoid "spillage" with the brains of general population, as I belive 
they are substandard, no matter how much money they have — combined. /s/ 
Bo Dincer.


  *Checking this box authorizes the FDIC to respond to your inquiry, no 
check box on the lease for the unlawful legal RECEIPTS which also may or 
may have been used in furtherance of the SEC filer, item 10 in Madoff, 
and USC 18.21 Violated as misrepresented to the public and used in 
conjunction with USC 18.225.

P.S. stop spending all day evesdropping on emails, the students are 
there for a reason you idiots, go - do - something - else.


We.will track those as well.



- if you ask me, what was I doing while they were committing these 
felonies during the the Covid-19 pandemic, you'll have to reach out to 
the NSF as well, filed.

Farmers... how funny? Not for the farmers at 116th. guaranteed.


FACTS — plural.

— will also avoid prosecution at any cost.

concurrent sentences like the counselors of Bernie Madoff? How do I go 
about insuring those assets of mine which have NOT been returned as of

they have reported both vacancies and a growth +/- while considering the 
10 years prior did represent YoY changes which do not represent a

   (1) any property was embezzled, robbed, stolen, converted, taken, 
altered, counterfeited, falsely made, forged, or obliterated; and
   (2) the defendant knew that the property was of such character;

converted, taken, altered, counterfeited, falsely made, forged, or 
obliterated.
</p>

United States Code, to use or invest, directly or indirectly, any part 
of such income, or the proceeds of such income, in acquisition of any 
interest in, or the establishment or operation of, any enterprise which 
is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign 
commerce. A purchase of securities on the open market for purposes of 
investment, and without the intention of controlling or participating in 
the control of the issuer, or of assisting another to do so, shall not 
be unlawful under this subsection if the securities of the issuer held 
by the purchaser, the members of his immediate family, and his or their 
accomplices in any pattern or racketeering activity or the collection of

directors of the issuer.

(b) It shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern of

(d) It shall be unlawful for any person to conspire to violate any of 
the provisions of subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this section.
</p>

§1963. Criminal penalties
<p>

(a) Whoever violates any provision of section 1962 of this chapter shall 
be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years (or for 
life if the violation is based on a racketeering activity for which the 
maximum penalty includes life imprisonment), or both, and shall forfeit

person obtained, directly or indirectly, from racketeering activity or 
unlawful debt collection in violation of section 1962.
The court, in imposing sentence on such person shall order, in addition 
to any other sentence imposed pursuant to this section, that the person 
forfeit to the United States all property described in this subsection. 
In lieu of a fine otherwise authorized by this section, a defendant who 
derives profits or other proceeds from an offense may be fined not more 
than twice the gross profits or other proceeds.
(b) Property subject to criminal forfeiture under this section includes-
(1) real property, including things growing on, affixed to, and found in 
land; and
(2) tangible and intangible personal property, including rights, 
privileges, interests, claims, and securities.

### USC 18. §208. Acts affecting a personal financial interest


(a) Except as permitted by subsection (b) hereof, whoever, being an 
officer or employee of the executive branch of the United States 
Government, or of any independent agency of the United States, a Federal 
Reserve bank director, officer, or employee, or an officer or employee 
of the District of Columbia, including a special Government employee, 
participates personally and substantially as a Government officer or 
employee, through decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, the 
rendering of advice, investigation, or otherwise, in a judicial or other 
proceeding, application, request for a ruling or other determination, 
contract, claim, controversy, charge, accusation, arrest, or other 
particular matter in which, to his knowledge, he, his spouse, minor 
child, general partner, organization in which he is serving as officer, 
director, trustee, general partner or employee, or any person or 
organization with whom he is negotiating or has any arrangement 
concerning prospective employment, has a financial interest-Shall be 
subject to the penalties set forth in section 216 of this title.
(b) Subsection (a) shall not apply-
(1) if the officer or employee first advises the Government official 
responsible for appointment to his or her position of the nature and 
circumstances of the judicial or other proceeding, application, request 
for a ruling or other determination, contract, claim, controversy, 
charge, accusation, arrest, or other particular matter and makes full 
disclosure of the financial interest and receives in advance a written 
determination made by such official that the interest is not so 
substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the integrity of the 
services which the Government may expect from such officer or employee;
(2) if, by regulation issued by the Director of the Office of Government 
Ethics, applicable to all or a portion of all officers and employees 
covered by this section, and published in the Federal Register, the 
financial interest has been exempted from the requirements of subsection 
(a) as being too remote or too inconsequential to affect the integrity 
of the services of the Government officers or employees to which such 
regulation applies;
(3) in the case of a special Government employee serving on an advisory 
committee within the meaning of the Federal Advisory Committee Act 
(including an individual being considered for an appointment to such a 
position), the official responsible for the employee's appointment, 
after review of the financial disclosure report filed by the individual 
pursuant to the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, certifies in writing 
that the need for the individual's services outweighs the potential for 
a conflict of interest created by the financial interest involved...

Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act permits the Commission to sanction 
any person who, at the time of the misconduct, was associated with an 
investment adviser, if the Commission finds that the sanction is in the 
public interest and the person has been convicted of any offense 
specified in Section 203(e)(2) within ten years of the commencement of 
proceedings. 15 U.S.C. § 80b3(e)(2),(f).

conspiracy to commit securities fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371;
conspiracy to commit wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1349;
securities fraud, in violation of 15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b), 78ff, and 17 CFR

On June 23, 2014, Balboa was sentenced to a prison term of fortyeight 
months, to run concurrently on all counts, followed by three years of 
supervised release, and ordered to pay restitution of $390,243,873.92 
and to forfeit $2,223,000.

15 U.S.C. § 80b3(e)(2)(A).
Ex. C at 1-2; Exs. D, E. The superseding indictment charged Balboa with, 
among other things, engaging in a scheme to falsely inflate the value of 
illiquid securities between January 2008 and October 2008 and with 
committing wire fraud.

15 U.S. Code § 78r - Liability for misleading statements
(a)Persons liable; persons entitled to recover; defense of good faith; 
suit at law or in equity; costs, etc.
Any person who shall make or cause to be made any statement in any 
application, report, or document filed pursuant to this chapter or any 
rule or regulation thereunder or any undertaking contained in a 
registration statement as provided in subsection (d) of section 78o of 
this title, which statement was at the time and in the light of the 
circumstances under which it was made false or misleading with respect 
to any material fact, shall be liable to any person (not knowing that 
such statement was false or misleading) who, in reliance upon such 
statement, shall have purchased or sold a security at a price which was 
affected by such statement, for damages caused by such reliance, unless 
the person sued shall prove that he acted in good faith and had no 
knowledge that such statement was false or misleading. A person seeking 
to enforce such liability may sue at law or in equity in any court of 
competent jurisdiction. In any such suit the court may, in its 
discretion, require an undertaking for the payment of the costs of such 
suit, and assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, 
against either party litigant.

(b)Contribution
Every person who becomes liable to make payment under this section may 
recover contribution as in cases of contract from any person who, if 
joined in the original suit, would have been liable to make the same 
payment.

(c)Period of limitations
No action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under 
this section unless brought within one year after the discovery of the 
facts constituting the cause of action and within three years after such 
cause of action accrued.

15 U.S. Code § 78s - Registration, responsibilities, and oversight of 
self-regulatory organizations
(5)The Commission shall consult with and consider the views of the 
Secretary of the Treasury prior to approving a proposed rule filed by a 
registered securities association that primarily concerns conduct 
related to transactions in government securities, except where the 
Commission determines that an emergency exists requiring expeditious or 
summary action and publishes its reasons therefor. If the Secretary of 
the Treasury comments in writing to the Commission on a proposed rule 
that has been published for comment, the Commission shall respond in 
writing to such written comment before approving the proposed rule. If 
the Secretary of the Treasury determines, and notifies the Commission, 
that such rule, if implemented, would, or as applied does (i) adversely 
affect the liquidity or efficiency of the market for government 
securities; or (ii) impose any burden on competition not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section, the 
Commission shall, prior to adopting the proposed rule, find that such 
rule is necessary and appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this 
section notwithstanding the Secretary’s determination.

[t]he proper functioning of the securities industry and markets depends 
on the
integrity of industry participants and their commitment to transparent 
disclosure.
Securities industry participation by persons with a history of 
fraudulent conduct is
antithetical to the protection of investors. . . . We have long held 
that a history of
egregious fraudulent conduct demonstrates unfitness for future 
participation in the
securities industry even if the disqualifying conduct is not related to the
professional capacity in which the respondent was acting when he or she 
engaged
in the misconduct underlying the proceeding. The industry relies on the 
fairness
and integrity of all persons associated with each of the professions 
covered by the
collateral bar to forgo opportunities to defraud and abuse other market
participants.



TRANSACTIONS OF CERTAIN AFFILIATED PERSONS AND UNDERWRITERS
-UNLAWFUL TRANSACTIONS
SEC. 17. (a)
It shall be unlawful for any affiliated person or pro- moter of or 
principal underwriter for a registered investment company (other than a 
company of the character described in section 12 (d) (3) (A) and (B)), 
or any affiliated person of such a person, promoter, or principal 
underwriter, acting as principal-
(1) knowingly to sell any security or other property to such registered 
company or to any company controlled by such regis- tered company, 
unless such sale involves solely (A) securities of which the buyer is 
the issuer, (B) securities of which the seller is the issuer and which 
are part of a general offering to the holders of a class of its 
securities, or (C) securities deposited with the trustee of a unit 
investment trust or periodic payment plan by the depositor thereof;

(2) knowingly to purchase from such registered company, or from any 
company controlled by such registered company, any security or other 
property (except securities of which the seller is the issuer)


Liability of directors, etc., for willful misfeasance.
SEC. 17.
(h)     After one year from the effective date of this title, neither
the charter, certificate of incorporation, articles of association, 
indenture of trust, nor the by-laws of any registered investment 
company, nor any other instrument pursuant to which such a company is 
organized or administered, shall contain any provision which protects or 
purports to protect any director or officer of such company against any 
liability to the company or to its security holders to which he would 
otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross 
negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct 
of his office.

         In the event that any such instrument does not at the effective 
date of this Act comply with the requirements of this subsection (h) and 
is not amended to comply therewith prior to the expiration of said one 
year, such company may nevertheless continue to be a registered 
investment company and shall not be deemed to violate this subsection if 
prior to said expiration date each such director or officer shall have 
filed with the Commission a waiver in writing of any protective 
provision of the instrument to the extent that it does not comply with 
this subsection, and each such person subsequently elected or appointed 
shall before assuming office file a similar waiver.

(i)     After one year from the effective date of this title no contract 
or agreement under which any person undertakes to act as investment 
adviser of, or principal underwriter for, a registered investment 
company shall contain any provision which protects or purports to 
protect such person against any liability to such company or its 
security holders to which he would otherwise be subject by reason of 
willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence, in the performance 
of his duties, or by reason of his reckless disregard of his obligations 
and duties under such contract or agreement.

Injunctions against gross abuse.
SEC. 36.
The Commission is authorized to bring an action in the proper district 
court of the United States or United States court of
any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United 
States, alleging that a person serving or acting in one or more of the 
following capacities has been guilty, after the enactment of this title 
and within five years of the commencement of the action, of gross 
misconduct or gross abuse of trust in respect of any registered 
investment company for which such person so serves or acts:
(1) as officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment 
adviser, or depositor; or
(2) as principal underwriter, if such registered company is an open-end 
company, unit investment trust, or face-amount
certificate company.
If the Commission's allegations of such gross misconduct or gross abuse 
of trust are established, the court shall enjoin such person from acting 
in such capacity or capacities either permanently or for such period of 
time as it in its discretion shall deem appropriate.


SEC. 32.
(c) The Commission is authorized, by rules and regulations or order in 
the public interest or for the protection of investors, to require 
accountants and auditors to keep reports, work sheets, and other 
documents and papers relating to registered investment companies for 
such period or periods as the Commission may prescribe, and to make the 
same available for inspection by the Commission or any member or 
representative thereof.


DESTRUCTION AND FALSIFICATION OF REPORTS AND RECORDS
SEC. 34.

(a) It shall be unlawful for any person, except as permitted by rule, 
regulation, or order of the Commission, willfully to
destroy, mutilate, or alter any account, book, or other document the 
preservation of which has been required pursuant to section 31 (a) or 32 
(c).
(b) It shall be unlawful for any person to make any untrue statement of 
a material fact in any registration statement, application, report, 
account, record, or other document filed or transmitted pursuant to this 
title or the keeping of which is required pursuant to section 31 (a).

It shall be unlawful for any person so filing, transmitting, or keeping 
any such document to omit to state therein any fact necessary in order 
to prevent the statements made therein, in the light of the 
circumstances under which they were made, from being materially 
misleading. For the purposes of this subsection, any part of any such 
document which is signed or certified by an accountant or auditor in his 
capacity as such shall be deemed to be made, filed, transmitted, or kept 
by such accountant or auditor, as well as by the person filing, 
transmitting, or keeping the complete document.

6664(a) and
§ 1.6664-2, of any income tax imposed under chapter 1 of subtitle A of 
the Code that is
required to be shown on a return is attributable to a substantial 
valuation misstatement
under chapter 1 (“substantial valuation misstatement”), there is added 
to the tax an amount equal to 20 percent of such portion.

Section 6662(h) increases the penalty to 40 percent in the case of a 
gross valuation misstatement under chapter 1
(“gross valuation misstatement”).
No penalty under section 6662(b)(3) is imposed, however, on a portion of 
an underpayment
that is attributable to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement 
unless the aggregate
of all portions of the underpayment attributable to substantial or gross 
valuation misstatements
exceeds the applicable dollar limitation ($5,000 or $10,000), as 
provided in section 6662(e)(2) and paragraphs
(b) and
(f)(2) of this section.
This penalty also does not apply to the extent that the reasonable cause 
and good faith exception to this penalty
set forth in § 1.6664-4 applies. There is no disclosure exception to 
this penalty.

(b) Dollar limitation.
No penalty may be imposed under section 6662(b)(3) for a taxable year unless

the portion of the underpayment for that year that is attributable to 
substantial or gross valuation misstatements exceeds $5,000
($10,000 in the case of a corporation other than an S corporation (as 
defined in section 1361(a)(1));

or a personal holding company (as defined in section 542)).

This limitation is applied separately to each taxable year for which 
there is a substantial or gross valuation misstatement.



(e) Definitions -

(1) Substantial valuation misstatement.
There is a substantial valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted 
basis of any property claimed on a
return of tax imposed under chapter 1 is 200 percent or more of the 
correct amount.

(2) Gross valuation misstatement.
There is a gross valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted basis 
of any property claimed on a return of tax
imposed under chapter 1 is 400 percent or more of the correct amount.

(3) Property.
For purposes of this section, the term “property” refers to both 
tangible and intangible property.
Tangible property includes property such as land, buildings, fixtures 
and inventory.
Intangible property includes property such as goodwill, covenants not to 
compete, leaseholds, patents,
contract rights, debts and choses in action.


(f) Multiple valuation misstatements on a return -

(1) Determination of whether valuation misstatements are substantial or 
gross.
The determination of whether there is a substantial or gross valuation 
misstatement on a return is
made on a property-by-property basis. Assume, for example, that property 
A has a value of 60 but a taxpayer claims a value of 110,
and that property B has a value of 40 but the taxpayer claims a value of 
100.

Because the claimed and correct values are compared on a 
property-by-property basis,
there is a substantial valuation misstatement with respect to property 
B, but not with respect to property A,
even though the claimed values (210) are 200 percent or more of the 
correct values (100) when compared on an aggregate basis.

(2) Application of dollar limitation. For purposes of applying the 
dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2),
the determination of the portion of an underpayment that is attributable 
to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement
is made by aggregating all portions of the underpayment attributable to 
substantial or gross valuation misstatements.

Assume, for example, that the value claimed for property C on a return 
is 250 percent of the correct value, and that the value claimed for 
property D on the return is 400 percent of the correct value.
Because the portions of an underpayment that are attributable to a 
substantial or gross valuation misstatement on a return are aggregated 
in applying the dollar limitation, the dollar limitation is satisfied if 
the portion of the underpayment that is attributable to the misstatement 
of the value of property C, when aggregated with the portion of the 
underpayment that is attributable to the misstatement of the value of 
property D, exceeds $5,000 ($10,000 in the case of most corporations).

(g) Property with a value or adjusted basis of zero.

The value or adjusted basis claimed on a return of any property with a 
correct value or adjusted basis of zero is considered to be 400 percent 
or more of the correct amount. There is a gross valuation misstatement 
with respect to such property, therefore, and the applicable penalty 
rate is 40 percent.

HOW TO VALUE A PROPERTY WITH LEGAL INCOME = $0.00

(e) Definitions -

(1) Substantial valuation misstatement.
There is a substantial valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted 
basis of any property claimed on a
return of tax imposed under chapter 1 is 200 percent or more of the 
correct amount.

(2) Gross valuation misstatement.
There is a gross valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted basis 
of any property claimed on a return of tax
imposed under chapter 1 is 400 percent or more of the correct amount.

(3) Property.
For purposes of this section, the term “property” refers to both 
tangible and intangible property.
Tangible property includes property such as land, buildings, fixtures 
and inventory.
Intangible property includes property such as goodwill, covenants not to 
compete, leaseholds, patents,
contract rights, debts and choses in action.


(f) Multiple valuation misstatements on a return -

(1) Determination of whether valuation misstatements are substantial or 
gross.
The determination of whether there is a substantial or gross valuation 
misstatement on a return is
made on a property-by-property basis. Assume, for example, that property 
A has a value of 60 but a taxpayer claims a value of 110,
and that property B has a value of 40 but the taxpayer claims a value of 
100.

Because the claimed and correct values are compared on a 
property-by-property basis,
there is a substantial valuation misstatement with respect to property 
B, but not with respect to property A,
even though the claimed values (210) are 200 percent or more of the 
correct values (100) when compared on an aggregate basis.

(2) Application of dollar limitation. For purposes of applying the 
dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2),
the determination of the portion of an underpayment that is attributable 
to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement
is made by aggregating all portions of the underpayment attributable to 
substantial or gross valuation misstatements.

Assume, for example, that the value claimed for property C on a return 
is 250 percent of the correct value, and that the value claimed for 
property D on the return is 400 percent of the correct value.
Because the portions of an underpayment that are attributable to a 
substantial or gross valuation misstatement on a return are aggregated 
in applying the dollar limitation, the dollar limitation is satisfied if 
the portion of the underpayment that is attributable to the misstatement 
of the value of property C, when aggregated with the portion of the 
underpayment that is attributable to the misstatement of the value of 
property D, exceeds $5,000 ($10,000 in the case of most corporations).

(g) Property with a value or adjusted basis of zero.

The value or adjusted basis claimed on a return of any property with a 
correct value or adjusted basis of zero is considered to be 400 percent 
or more of the correct amount. There is a gross valuation misstatement 
with respect to such property, therefore, and the applicable penalty 
rate is 40 percent.

15 U.S. Code § 78r - Liability for misleading statements
(a)Persons liable; persons entitled to recover; defense of good faith; 
suit at law or in equity; costs, etc.
Any person who shall make or cause to be made any statement in any 
application, report, or document filed pursuant to this chapter or any 
rule or regulation thereunder or any undertaking contained in a 
registration statement as provided in subsection (d) of section 78o of 
this title, which statement was at the time and in the light of the 
circumstances under which it was made false or misleading with respect 
to any material fact, shall be liable to any person (not knowing that 
such statement was false or misleading) who, in reliance upon such 
statement, shall have purchased or sold a security at a price which was 
affected by such statement, for damages caused by such reliance, unless 
the person sued shall prove that he acted in good faith and had no 
knowledge that such statement was false or misleading. A person seeking 
to enforce such liability may sue at law or in equity in any court of 
competent jurisdiction. In any such suit the court may, in its 
discretion, require an undertaking for the payment of the costs of such 
suit, and assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, 
against either party litigant.

(b)Contribution
Every person who becomes liable to make payment under this section may 
recover contribution as in cases of contract from any person who, if 
joined in the original suit, would have been liable to make the same 
payment.

(c)Period of limitations
No action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under 
this section unless brought within one year after the discovery of the 
facts constituting the cause of action and within three years after such 
cause of action accrued.


[SFITX]
15 U.S. Code § 78s - Registration, responsibilities, and oversight of 
self-regulatory organizations
(5)The Commission shall consult with and consider the views of the 
Secretary of the Treasury prior to approving a proposed rule filed by a 
registered securities association that primarily concerns conduct 
related to transactions in government securities, except where the 
Commission determines that an emergency exists requiring expeditious or 
summary action and publishes its reasons therefor. If the Secretary of 
the Treasury comments in writing to the Commission on a proposed rule 
that has been published for comment, the Commission shall respond in 
writing to such written comment before approving the proposed rule. If 
the Secretary of the Treasury determines, and notifies the Commission, 
that such rule, if implemented, would, or as applied does (i) adversely 
affect the liquidity or efficiency of the market for government 
securities; or (ii) impose any burden on competition not necessary or 
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section, the 
Commission shall, prior to adopting the proposed rule, find that such 
rule is necessary and appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this 
section notwithstanding the Secretary’s determination.

[t]he proper functioning of the securities industry and markets depends 
on the
integrity of industry participants and their commitment to transparent 
disclosure.
Securities industry participation by persons with a history of 
fraudulent conduct is
antithetical to the protection of investors. . . . We have long held 
that a history of
egregious fraudulent conduct demonstrates unfitness for future 
participation in the
securities industry even if the disqualifying conduct is not related to the
professional capacity in which the respondent was acting when he or she 
engaged
in the misconduct underlying the proceeding. The industry relies on the 
fairness
and integrity of all persons associated with each of the professions 
covered by the
collateral bar to forgo opportunities to defraud and abuse other market
participants.

TRANSACTIONS OF CERTAIN AFFILIATED PERSONS AND UNDERWRITERS
-UNLAWFUL TRANSACTIONS
SEC. 17. (a)
It shall be unlawful for any affiliated person or pro- moter of or 
principal underwriter for a registered investment company (other than a 
company of the character described in section 12 (d) (3) (A) and (B)), 
or any affiliated person of such a person, promoter, or principal 
underwriter, acting as principal-
(1) knowingly to sell any security or other property to such registered 
company or to any company controlled by such regis- tered company, 
unless such sale involves solely (A) securities of which the buyer is 
the issuer, (B) securities of which the seller is the issuer and which 
are part of a general offering to the holders of a class of its 
securities, or (C) securities deposited with the trustee of a unit 
investment trust or periodic payment plan by the depositor thereof;

(2) knowingly to purchase from such registered company, or from any 
company controlled by such registered company, any security or other 
property (except securities of which the seller is the issuer)


Liability of directors, etc., for willful misfeasance.
SEC. 17.
(h)     After one year from the effective date of this title, neither
the charter, certificate of incorporation, articles of association, 
indenture of trust, nor the by-laws of any registered investment 
company, nor any other instrument pursuant to which such a company is 
organized or administered, shall contain any provision which protects or 
purports to protect any director or officer of such company against any 
liability to the company or to its security holders to which he would 
otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross 
negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct 
of his office.

         In the event that any such instrument does not at the effective 
date of this Act comply with the requirements of this subsection (h) and 
is not amended to comply therewith prior to the expiration of said one 
year, such company may nevertheless continue to be a registered 
investment company and shall not be deemed to violate this subsection if 
prior to said expiration date each such director or officer shall have 
filed with the Commission a waiver in writing of any protective 
provision of the instrument to the extent that it does not comply with 
this subsection, and each such person subsequently elected or appointed 
shall before assuming office file a similar waiver.

(i)     After one year from the effective date of this title no contract 
or agreement under which any person undertakes to act as investment 
adviser of, or principal underwriter for, a registered investment 
company shall contain any provision which protects or purports to 
protect such person against any liability to such company or its 
security holders to which he would otherwise be subject by reason of 
willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence, in the performance 
of his duties, or by reason of his reckless disregard of his obligations 
and duties under such contract or agreement.

Injunctions against gross abuse.
SEC. 36.
The Commission is authorized to bring an action in the proper district 
court of the United States or United States court of
any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United 
States, alleging that a person serving or acting in one or more of the 
following capacities has been guilty, after the enactment of this title 
and within five years of the commencement of the action, of gross 
misconduct or gross abuse of trust in respect of any registered 
investment company for which such person so serves or acts:
(1) as officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment 
adviser, or depositor; or
(2) as principal underwriter, if such registered company is an open-end 
company, unit investment trust, or face-amount
certificate company.
If the Commission's allegations of such gross misconduct or gross abuse 
of trust are established, the court shall enjoin such person from acting 
in such capacity or capacities either permanently or for such period of 
time as it in its discretion shall deem appropriate.


SEC. 32.
(c) The Commission is authorized, by rules and regulations or order in 
the public interest or for the protection of investors, to require 
accountants and auditors to keep reports, work sheets, and other 
documents and papers relating to registered investment companies for 
such period or periods as the Commission may prescribe, and to make the 
same available for inspection by the Commission or any member or 
representative thereof.


DESTRUCTION AND FALSIFICATION OF REPORTS AND RECORDS
SEC. 34.

(a) It shall be unlawful for any person, except as permitted by rule, 
regulation, or order of the Commission, willfully to
destroy, mutilate, or alter any account, book, or other document the 
preservation of which has been required pursuant to section 31 (a) or 32 
(c).
(b) It shall be unlawful for any person to make any untrue statement of 
a material fact in any registration statement, application, report, 
account, record, or other document filed or transmitted pursuant to this 
title or the keeping of which is required pursuant to section 31 (a).

It shall be unlawful for any person so filing, transmitting, or keeping 
any such document to omit to state therein any fact necessary in order 
to prevent the statements made therein, in the light of the 
circumstances under which they were made, from being materially 
misleading. For the purposes of this subsection, any part of any such 
document which is signed or certified by an accountant or auditor in his 
capacity as such shall be deemed to be made, filed, transmitted, or kept 
by such accountant or auditor, as well as by the person filing, 
transmitting, or keeping the complete document.

CARRIED INTEREST ON BACK TAXES HAS ACCURED THE GREATER OF TWO YEARS 
SINCE THEY FIRST FILED A FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT.
     - TRIED TO KEEP ME OCCUPIED, AND SLOW DOWN THE INEVITABLE (AT THIS 
POINT)

SORRY, THEY REFUSE TO COME CLEAN, EVEN ABOUT THE 90-DAY WINDOW WHERE 
STATE FARM WOULD HAVE TERMINATED THE LOAN FOR A BREACH, I PUT THE CLAUSE 
FROM THEIR LOAN ON THE DOCKET (90-DAY DEFAULT PROVISION WAS SO THAT 
STATE FARM CAN WAKE UP AND CANCEL THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THESE 
ZZZZUCKERS, IMMEDIATELY) INSTEAD - MORE EMAILS AND VIDEO.MOV FILES 
ALTERED, PHOTOSHOP, AND CIRCULATED WITHOUT MY CONSENT BY AND BETWEEN 
THEIR REPRESENTATIVES AS WELL - THE INTERIOR OF MY APARTMENT.

https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=Xjn0/e1NcBADqRc_PLUS_g11P4g==

- AFTER ALL THOSE FILINGS, AND INVASION... YOU WOULD HAVE TO ASSUME AT 
LEAST ONE OF THESE IDIOTS WOULD WRITE BACK ?

- THEY MUST BE AT THE COMMUNITY BOARD , MY BAD... I'LL JUST LET THEM 
STEAL MY MONEY AS WELL, THEY ONLY STOLE ABOUT $500,000,000.00 IN TAX 
DOLLARS FROM FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL FUNDS..


-- CARRIES INTEREST DAILY.

#GOCARDS, I ANNEXED THEIR "OUT" IN THE CHANGE TO CAPTION WITHIN THE 
90-DAY WINDOW. - INSTEAD, OBSTRUCTION WAS A PREFERRED METHOD.

- I WAS NOT PERMITTED TO FILE A MOTION, ONLY EXHIBITS.
ALL SIX PROPERTIES BACK 10-YEARS PLUS.
- KNOWN BY THEIR REPRESENTATIVES AS WELL... ALL OF THEM WELL VERSED

UNTIL THEY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THE TRUTH.
 > THAT'S TWO YEARS CARRIED INTEREST... BUT OWED BY STATE FARM 
IMMEDIATELY AND WILL BE "REIUMBURSED" BY THE ZUCKER FAMILY.

GOOD LUCK

USC 18, § 373 - Solicitation to commit a crime of violence

(a) Whoever, with intent that another person engage in conduct 
constituting a felony that has as an element the use, attempted use, or 
threatened use of physical force against property or against the person 
of another in violation of the laws of the United States, and under 
circumstances strongly corroborative of that intent, solicits, commands,

(b) It is an affirmative defence to a prosecution under this section 
that, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete 
renunciation of his criminal intent, the defendant prevented the 
commission of the crime solicited. A renunciation is not "voluntary and 
complete" if it is motivated in whole or in part by a decision to 
postpone the commission of the crime until another time or to substitute 
another victim or another but similar objective. If the defendant raises 
the affirmative defence at trial, the defendant has the burden of 
proving the defence by a preponderance of the evidence.
     (c) It is not a defence to a prosecution under this section that 
the person solicited could not be convicted of the crime because he 
lacked the state of mind required for its commission, because he was 
incompetent or irresponsible, or because he is immune from prosecution 
or is not subject to prosecution.
USC 18 [ FORFEITURES ] >> RISKS HELD UNDER STATE FARM AT THE OBSTRUCTION 
OF THE COUNSELORS IN NYSCEF 153974/2020

§229B. Criminal forfeitures; destruction of weapons
     (a) Property Subject to Criminal Forfeiture.
     -Any person convicted under section 229A(a) shall forfeit to the 
United States irrespective of any provision of State law-
         (1) any property, real or personal, owned, possessed, or used 
by a person involved in the offense;
         (2) any property constituting, or derived from, and proceeds 
the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of such 
violation; and
         (3) any of the property used in any manner or part, to commit, 
or to facilitate the commission of, such violation.

     The court, in imposing sentence on such person, shall order, in 
addition to any other sentence imposed pursuant to section 229A(a), that 
the person forfeit to the United States all property described in this 
subsection. In lieu of a fine otherwise authorized by section 229A(a), a 
defendant who derived profits or other proceeds from an offense may be 
fined not more than twice the gross profits or other proceeds.
     (b) Procedures.-
         (1) General.
         -Property subject to forfeiture under this section, any seizure 
and disposition thereof, and any administrative or judicial proceeding 
in relation thereto, shall be governed by subsections (b) through (p) of 
section 413 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act 
of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853), except that any reference under those 
subsections to-
             (A) "this subchapter or subchapter II" shall be deemed to 
be a reference to section 229A(a); and
             (B) "subsection (a)" shall be deemed to be a reference to 
subsection (a) of this section.
         (2) Temporary restraining orders.-
             (A)     In general.-For the purposes of forfeiture 
proceedings under this section, a temporary restraining order may be 
entered upon application of the United States without notice or 
opportunity for a hearing when an information or indictment has not yet 
been filed with respect to the property, if, in addition to the 
circumstances described in section 413(e)(2) of the Comprehensive Drug 
Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2)), the 
United States demonstrates that there is probable cause to believe that 
the property with respect to which the order is sought would, in the 
event of conviction, be subject to forfeiture under this section and 
exigent circumstances exist that place the life or health of any person 
in danger.
             (B)     Warrant of seizure.-If the court enters a temporary 
restraining order under this paragraph, it shall also issue a warrant 
authorizing the seizure of such property.
             (C)     Applicable procedures.-The procedures and time 
limits applicable to temporary restraining orders under section 
413(e)(2) and (3) of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control 
Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2) and (3)) shall apply to temporary 
restraining orders under this paragraph.
     (c) Affirmative Defense.
         -It is an affirmative defense against a forfeiture under 
subsection (b) that the property-
         (1) is for a purpose not prohibited under the Chemical Weapons 
Convention; and
         (2) is of a type and quantity that under the circumstances is 
consistent with that purpose.
     (d) Destruction or Other Disposition.-The Attorney General shall 
provide for the destruction or other appropriate disposition of any 
chemical weapon seized and forfeited pursuant to this section.
     (e) Assistance.
     (f) Owner Liability.
         -The owner or possessor of any property seized under this 
section shall be liable to the United States for any expenses incurred 
incident to the seizure, including any expenses relating to the 
handling, storage, transportation, and destruction or other disposition 
of the seized property

agency involved, may declare void and rescind any contract, loan, grant, 
subsidy, license, right, permit, franchise, use, authority, privilege, 
benefit, certificate, ruling, decision, opinion, or rate schedule 
awarded, granted, paid, furnished, or published, or the performance of 
any service or transfer or delivery of any thing to, by or for any 
agency of the United States or officer or employee of the United States 
or person acting on behalf thereof, in relation to which there has been 
a final conviction for any violation of this chapter, and the United 
States shall be entitled to recover in addition to any penalty 
prescribed by law or in a contract the amount expended or the thing 
transferred or delivered on its behalf, or the reasonable value thereof.

     (a) The punishment for an offense under section 203, 204, 205, 207, 
208, or 209 of this title is the following:
         (1) Whoever engages in the conduct constituting the offense 
shall be imprisoned for not more than one year or fined in the amount 
set forth in this title, or both.
         (2) Whoever willfully engages in the conduct constituting the 
offense shall be imprisoned for not more than five years or fined in the 
amount set forth in this title, or both.
     (b)     The Attorney General may bring a civil action in the 
appropriate United States district court against any person who engages 
in conduct constituting an offense under section 203, 204, 205, 207, 
208, or 209 of this title and, upon proof of such conduct by a 
preponderance of the evidence, such person shall be subject to a civil 
penalty of not more than $50,000 for each violation or the amount of 
compensation which the person received or offered for the prohibited 
conduct, whichever amount is greater. The imposition of a civil penalty 
under this subsection does not preclude any other criminal or civil 
statutory, common law, or administrative remedy, which is available by 
law to the United States or any other person.
     (c) If the Attorney General has reason to believe that a person is 
engaging in conduct constituting an offense under section 203, 204, 205, 
207, 208, or 209 of this title, the Attorney General may petition an 
appropriate United States district court for an order prohibiting that 
person from engaging in such conduct. The court may issue an order 
prohibiting that person from engaging in such conduct if the court finds 
that the conduct constitutes such an offense. The filing of a petition 
under this section does not preclude any other remedy which is available 
by law to the United States or any other person.

USC 18, § 373 - Solicitation to commit a crime of violence

(a) Whoever, with intent that another person engage in conduct 
constituting a felony that has as an element the use, attempted use, or 
threatened use of physical force against property or against the person 
of another in violation of the laws of the United States, and under 
circumstances strongly corroborative of that intent, solicits, commands, 
induces, or otherwise endeavours to persuade such other person to engage 
in such conduct, shall be imprisoned not more than one-half the maximum 
term of imprisonment or (notwithstanding section 3571) fined not more

(b) It is an affirmative defence to a prosecution under this section 
that, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete 
renunciation of his criminal intent, the defendant prevented the 
commission of the crime solicited. A renunciation is not "voluntary and 
complete" if it is motivated in whole or in part by a decision to 
postpone the commission of the crime until another time or to substitute 
another victim or another but similar objective. If the defendant raises 
the affirmative defence at trial, the defendant has the burden of 
proving the defence by a preponderance of the evidence.
     (c) It is not a defence to a prosecution under this section that 
the person solicited could not be convicted of the crime because he 
lacked the state of mind required for its commission, because he was 
incompetent or irresponsible, or because he is immune from prosecution 
or is not subject to prosecution.
USC 18 [ FORFEITURES ] >> RISKS HELD UNDER STATE FARM AT THE OBSTRUCTION 
OF THE COUNSELORS IN NYSCEF 153974/2020

§229B. Criminal forfeitures; destruction of weapons
     (a) Property Subject to Criminal Forfeiture.
     -Any person convicted under section 229A(a) shall forfeit to the 
United States irrespective of any provision of State law-
         (1) any property, real or personal, owned, possessed, or used 
by a person involved in the offense;
         (2) any property constituting, or derived from, and proceeds 
the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of such 
violation; and
         (3) any of the property used in any manner or part, to commit, 
or to facilitate the commission of, such violation.

     The court, in imposing sentence on such person, shall order, in 
addition to any other sentence imposed pursuant to section 229A(a), that 
the person forfeit to the United States all property described in this 
subsection. In lieu of a fine otherwise authorized by section 229A(a), a 
defendant who derived profits or other proceeds from an offense may be 
fined not more than twice the gross profits or other proceeds.
     (b) Procedures.-
         (1) General.
         -Property subject to forfeiture under this section, any seizure 
and disposition thereof, and any administrative or judicial proceeding 
in relation thereto, shall be governed by subsections (b) through (p) of 
section 413 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act 
of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853), except that any reference under those 
subsections to-
             (A) "this subchapter or subchapter II" shall be deemed to 
be a reference to section 229A(a); and
             (B) "subsection (a)" shall be deemed to be a reference to 
subsection (a) of this section.
         (2) Temporary restraining orders.-
             (A)     In general.-For the purposes of forfeiture 
proceedings under this section, a temporary restraining order may be

been filed with respect to the property, if, in addition to the 
circumstances described in section 413(e)(2) of the Comprehensive Drug 
Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2)), the 
United States demonstrates that there is probable cause to believe that 
the property with respect to which the order is sought would, in the 
event of conviction, be subject to forfeiture under this section and 
exigent circumstances exist that place the life or health of any person 
in danger.
             (B)     Warrant of seizure.-If the court enters a temporary 
restraining order under this paragraph, it shall also issue a warrant 
authorizing the seizure of such property.
             (C)     Applicable procedures.-The procedures and time 
limits applicable to temporary restraining orders under section 
413(e)(2) and (3) of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control 
Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 853(e)(2) and (3)) shall apply to temporary 
restraining orders under this paragraph.
     (c) Affirmative Defense.
         -It is an affirmative defense against a forfeiture under 
subsection (b) that the property-
         (1) is for a purpose not prohibited under the Chemical Weapons 
Convention; and
         (2) is of a type and quantity that under the circumstances is 
consistent with that purpose.
     (d) Destruction or Other Disposition.-The Attorney General shall 
provide for the destruction or other appropriate disposition of any 
chemical weapon seized and forfeited pursuant to this section.
     (e) Assistance.
     (f) Owner Liability.
         -The owner or possessor of any property seized under this 
section shall be liable to the United States for any expenses incurred 
incident to the seizure, including any expenses relating to the 
handling, storage, transportation, and destruction or other disposition 
of the seized property

awarded, granted, paid, furnished, or published, or the performance of 
any service or transfer or delivery of any thing to, by or for any 
agency of the United States or officer or employee of the United States 
or person acting on behalf thereof, in relation to which there has been 
a final conviction for any violation of this chapter, and the United 
States shall be entitled to recover in addition to any penalty 
prescribed by law or in a contract the amount expended or the thing 
transferred or delivered on its behalf, or the reasonable value thereof.

208, or 209 of this title is the following:
         (1) Whoever engages in the conduct constituting the offense

preponderance of the evidence, such person shall be subject to a civil 
penalty of not more than $50,000 for each violation or the amount of 
compensation which the person received or offered for the prohibited 
conduct, whichever amount is greater. The imposition of a civil penalty 
under this subsection does not preclude any other criminal or civil 
statutory, common law, or administrative remedy, which is available by 
law to the United States or any other person.
     (c) If the Attorney General has reason to believe that a person is 
engaging in conduct constituting an offense under section 203, 204, 205, 
207, 208, or 209 of this title, the Attorney General may petition an 
appropriate United States district court for an order prohibiting that 
person from engaging in such conduct. The court may issue an order 
prohibiting that person from engaging in such conduct if the court finds 
that the conduct constitutes such an offense. The filing of a petition 
under this section does not preclude any other remedy which is available 
by law to the United States or any other person.

THE ZUCKER ENTERPRISES, filed 09/23/2020 to get another $600,000.00 from 
NYC during the pandemic while keeping me occupied with NYSCEF 153974/2020.
— I already informed all 15 of them, the Judge, and your own attorneys 
who are copied here to message Mr Sullivan Properties LP ( Zucker 
Enterprises LLC ) I already had that ownership structure in case I found 
something like this.

— faxed all relevant documents to the Judge, Clerk, as referenced in the 
matter of 153974/2020 as well.

    Despite the breach USC code 18.2, 18.3, 18.4, 18.21, 18.215, 18.225
    - do the counselors of Sullivan Properties also get charged
    concurrent sentences like the counselors of Bernie Madoff? How do I
    go about insuring those assets of mine which have NOT been returned
    as of current? I will not pursue the FDIC for my money, however
    other may, as they have reported both vacancies and a growth +/-
    while considering the 10 years prior did represent YoY changes which
    do not represent a natural NNN-Lease, as those would be linear.
    About MY deposit: My Deposit is being held at a bank that is, per
    FDIC guidelines, holding unlawful assets in custody<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    - as none of the properties in LOAN 50074 to State Farm Bank,
    FSB&lt;br&gt;<br>

    <br>
    =C2=A0have a certificate of occupancy.&lt;br&gt;<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    =C2=A0Hence, my concern is not only what happens to my rent and secur=
ity

    how many other Loans does State Farm have that are undisclosed,

    How do I go about insuring those assets of mine which have NOT been
    returned as of current? I will not pursue the FDIC for my money,
    however other may, as they have reported both vacancies and a growth
    +/- while considering the 10 years prior did represent YoY changes
    which do not represent a natural NNN-Lease, as those would be
    linear. About MY deposit: My Deposit is being held at a bank that

=C2=A0 The FDIC insures deposits held at member banks

    the loss of their deposits if an FDIC-insured bank fails. FDIC
    insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United
    States government. Since the FDIC began operations in 1934, no
    depositor has ever lost a penny of FDIC-insured deposits.<br>

    ### USC 18. =C2=A7208. Acts affecting a personal financial interest<b=
r>
    <br>
    <br>
    (a) Except as permitted by subsection (b) hereof, whoever, being an
    officer or employee of the executive branch of the United States
    Government, or of any independent agency of the United States, a
    Federal Reserve bank director, officer, or employee, or an officer
    or employee of the District of Columbia, including a special
    Government employee, participates personally and substantially as a
    Government officer or employee, through decision, approval,
    disapproval, recommendation, the rendering of advice, investigation,
    or otherwise, in a judicial or other proceeding, application,
    request for a ruling or other determination, contract, claim,
    controversy, charge, accusation, arrest, or other particular matter
    in which, to his knowledge, he, his spouse, minor child, general
    partner, organization in which he is serving as officer, director,
    trustee, general partner or employee, or any person or organization
    with whom he is negotiating or has any arrangement concerning
    prospective employment, has a financial interest-Shall be subject to
    the penalties set forth in section 216 of this title.<br>
    (b) Subsection (a) shall not apply-<br>
    (1) if the officer or employee first advises the Government official
    responsible for appointment to his or her position of the nature and
    circumstances of the judicial or other proceeding, application,
    request for a ruling or other determination, contract, claim,
    controversy, charge, accusation, arrest, or other particular matter
    and makes full disclosure of the financial interest and receives in
    advance a written determination made by such official that the
    interest is not so substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the
    integrity of the services which the Government may expect from such
    officer or employee;<br>
    (2) if, by regulation issued by the Director of the Office of
    Government Ethics, applicable to all or a portion of all officers
    and employees covered by this section, and published in the Federal
    Register, the financial interest has been exempted from the
    requirements of subsection (a) as being too remote or too
    inconsequential to affect the integrity of the services of the
    Government officers or employees to which such regulation applies;<br=
>
    (3) in the case of a special Government employee serving on an
    advisory committee within the meaning of the Federal Advisory
    Committee Act (including an individual being considered for an
    appointment to such a position), the official responsible for the
    employee's appointment, after review of the financial disclosure
    report filed by the individual pursuant to the Ethics in Government
    Act of 1978, certifies in writing that the need for the individual's
    services outweighs the potential for a conflict of interest created
    by the financial interest involved...<br>

    (5)The Commission shall consult with and consider the views of the
    Secretary of the Treasury prior to approving a proposed rule filed
    by a registered securities association that primarily concerns
    conduct related to transactions in government securities, except
    where the Commission determines that an emergency exists requiring
    expeditious or summary action and publishes its reasons therefor. If
    the Secretary of the Treasury comments in writing to the Commission
    on a proposed rule that has been published for comment, the
    Commission shall respond in writing to such written comment before
    approving the proposed rule. If the Secretary of the Treasury
    determines, and notifies the Commission, that such rule, if
    implemented, would, or as applied does (i) adversely affect the
    liquidity or efficiency of the market for government securities; or
    (ii) impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate
    in furtherance of the purposes of this section, the Commission

    [t]he proper functioning of the securities industry and markets
    depends on the<br>
    integrity of industry participants and their commitment to
    transparent disclosure.<br>
    Securities industry participation by persons with a history of
    fraudulent conduct is<br>
    antithetical to the protection of investors. . . . We have long held
    that a history of<br>
    egregious fraudulent conduct demonstrates unfitness for future
    participation in the<br>
    securities industry even if the disqualifying conduct is not related
    to the<br>
    professional capacity in which the respondent was acting when he or
    she engaged<br>
    in the misconduct underlying the proceeding. The industry relies on
    the fairness<br>
    and integrity of all persons associated with each of the professions
    covered by the<br>
    collateral bar to forgo opportunities to defraud and abuse other
    market<br>

    The Commission is authorized to bring an action in the proper
    district court of the United States or United States court of<br>
    any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the
    United States, alleging that a person serving or acting in one or
    more of the following capacities has been guilty, after the
    enactment of this title and within five years of the commencement of
    the action, of gross misconduct or gross abuse of trust in respect
    of any registered investment company for which such person so serves
    or acts:<br>
    (1) as officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment
    adviser, or depositor; or<br>
    (2) as principal underwriter, if such registered company is an
    open-end company, unit investment trust, or face-amount<br>

    destroy, mutilate, or alter any account, book, or other document the
    preservation of which has been required pursuant to section 31 (a)
    or 32 (c).<br>
    (b) It shall be unlawful for any person to make any untrue statement
    of a material fact in any registration statement, application,
    report, account, record, or other document filed or transmitted
    pursuant to this title or the keeping of which is required pursuant

    added to the tax an amount equal to 20 percent of such portion.<br>
    <br>
    Section 6662(h) increases the penalty to 40 percent in the case of a
    gross valuation misstatement under chapter 1<br>
    (=E2=80=9Cgross valuation misstatement=E2=80=9D).<br>
    No penalty under section 6662(b)(3) is imposed, however, on a
    portion of an underpayment<br>
    that is attributable to a substantial or gross valuation
    misstatement unless the aggregate<br>
    of all portions of the underpayment attributable to substantial or
    gross valuation misstatements<br>
    exceeds the applicable dollar limitation ($5,000 or $10,000), as
    provided in section 6662(e)(2) and paragraphs<br>
    (b) and<br>
    (f)(2) of this section.<br>
    This penalty also does not apply to the extent that the reasonable
    cause and good faith exception to this penalty<br>
    set forth in =C2=A7 1.6664-4 applies. There is no disclosure exceptio=
n to
    this penalty.<br>
    <br>
    (b) Dollar limitation.<br>
    No penalty may be imposed under section 6662(b)(3) for a taxable
    year unless<br>
    <br>
    the portion of the underpayment for that year that is attributable
    to substantial or gross valuation misstatements exceeds $5,000<br>
    ($10,000 in the case of a corporation other than an S corporation
    (as defined in section 1361(a)(1));<br>
    <br>
    or a personal holding company (as defined in section 542)).<br>
    <br>
    This limitation is applied separately to each taxable year for which
    there is a substantial or gross valuation misstatement.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    (e) Definitions -<br>
    <br>
    (1) Substantial valuation misstatement.<br>
    There is a substantial valuation misstatement if the value or
    adjusted basis of any property claimed on a<br>
    return of tax imposed under chapter 1 is 200 percent or more of the
    correct amount.<br>
    <br>
    (2) Gross valuation misstatement.<br>
    There is a gross valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted
    basis of any property claimed on a return of tax<br>
    imposed under chapter 1 is 400 percent or more of the correct
    amount.<br>
    <br>
    (3) Property.<br>
    For purposes of this section, the term =E2=80=9Cproperty=E2=80=9D ref=
ers to both
    tangible and intangible property.<br>
    Tangible property includes property such as land, buildings,
    fixtures and inventory.<br>
    Intangible property includes property such as goodwill, covenants
    not to compete, leaseholds, patents,<br>
    contract rights, debts and choses in action.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    (f) Multiple valuation misstatements on a return -<br>
    <br>
    (1) Determination of whether valuation misstatements are substantial
    or gross.<br>
    The determination of whether there is a substantial or gross
    valuation misstatement on a return is<br>
    made on a property-by-property basis. Assume, for example, that
    property A has a value of 60 but a taxpayer claims a value of 110,<br=
>
    and that property B has a value of 40 but the taxpayer claims a
    value of 100.<br>
    <br>
    Because the claimed and correct values are compared on a
    property-by-property basis,<br>
    there is a substantial valuation misstatement with respect to
    property B, but not with respect to property A,<br>
    even though the claimed values (210) are 200 percent or more of the
    correct values (100) when compared on an aggregate basis.<br>
    <br>
    (2) Application of dollar limitation. For purposes of applying the
    dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2),<br>
    the determination of the portion of an underpayment that is
    attributable to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement<br>
    is made by aggregating all portions of the underpayment attributable
    to substantial or gross valuation misstatements.<br>
    <br>
    Assume, for example, that the value claimed for property C on a
    return is 250 percent of the correct value, and that the value
    claimed for property D on the return is 400 percent of the correct
    value.<br>
    Because the portions of an underpayment that are attributable to a
    substantial or gross valuation misstatement on a return are
    aggregated in applying the dollar limitation, the dollar limitation
    is satisfied if the portion of the underpayment that is attributable
    to the misstatement of the value of property C, when aggregated with
    the portion of the underpayment that is attributable to the
    misstatement of the value of property D, exceeds $5,000 ($10,000 in
    the case of most corporations).<br>
    <br>
    (g) Property with a value or adjusted basis of zero.<br>
    <br>
    The value or adjusted basis claimed on a return of any property with
    a correct value or adjusted basis of zero is considered to be 400
    percent or more of the correct amount. There is a gross valuation
    misstatement with respect to such property, therefore, and the
    applicable penalty rate is 40 percent.<br>

    =C2=A0=C2=A0 =C2=A0<br>
    (e) Definitions -<br>
    <br>
    (1) Substantial valuation misstatement.<br>
    There is a substantial valuation misstatement if the value or
    adjusted basis of any property claimed on a<br>
    return of tax imposed under chapter 1 is 200 percent or more of the
    correct amount.<br>
    <br>
    (2) Gross valuation misstatement.<br>
    There is a gross valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted
    basis of any property claimed on a return of tax<br>
    imposed under chapter 1 is 400 percent or more of the correct
    amount.<br>
    <br>
    (3) Property.<br>
    For purposes of this section, the term =E2=80=9Cproperty=E2=80=9D ref=
ers to both
    tangible and intangible property.<br>
    Tangible property includes property such as land, buildings,
    fixtures and inventory.<br>
    Intangible property includes property such as goodwill, covenants
    not to compete, leaseholds, patents,<br>
    contract rights, debts and choses in action.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    (f) Multiple valuation misstatements on a return -<br>
    <br>
    (1) Determination of whether valuation misstatements are substantial
    or gross.<br>
    The determination of whether there is a substantial or gross
    valuation misstatement on a return is<br>
    made on a property-by-property basis. Assume, for example, that
    property A has a value of 60 but a taxpayer claims a value of 110,<br=
>
    and that property B has a value of 40 but the taxpayer claims a
    value of 100.<br>
    <br>
    Because the claimed and correct values are compared on a
    property-by-property basis,<br>
    there is a substantial valuation misstatement with respect to
    property B, but not with respect to property A,<br>
    even though the claimed values (210) are 200 percent or more of the
    correct values (100) when compared on an aggregate basis.<br>
    <br>
    (2) Application of dollar limitation. For purposes of applying the
    dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2),<br>
    the determination of the portion of an underpayment that is
    attributable to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement<br>
    is made by aggregating all portions of the underpayment attributable
    to substantial or gross valuation misstatements.<br>
    <br>
    Assume, for example, that the value claimed for property C on a
    return is 250 percent of the correct value, and that the value
    claimed for property D on the return is 400 percent of the correct
    value.<br>
    Because the portions of an underpayment that are attributable to a
    substantial or gross valuation misstatement on a return are
    aggregated in applying the dollar limitation, the dollar limitation
    is satisfied if the portion of the underpayment that is attributable
    to the misstatement of the value of property C, when aggregated with
    the portion of the underpayment that is attributable to the
    misstatement of the value of property D, exceeds $5,000 ($10,000 in
    the case of most corporations).<br>
    <br>
    (g) Property with a value or adjusted basis of zero.<br>
    <br>
    The value or adjusted basis claimed on a return of any property with
    a correct value or adjusted basis of zero is considered to be 400
    percent or more of the correct amount. There is a gross valuation
    misstatement with respect to such property, therefore, and the
    applicable penalty rate is 40 percent.<br>

    (5)The Commission shall consult with and consider the views of the

    by a registered securities association that primarily concerns
    conduct related to transactions in government securities, except
    where the Commission determines that an emergency exists requiring
    expeditious or summary action and publishes its reasons therefor. If
    the Secretary of the Treasury comments in writing to the Commission
    on a proposed rule that has been published for comment, the
    Commission shall respond in writing to such written comment before
    approving the proposed rule. If the Secretary of the Treasury
    determines, and notifies the Commission, that such rule, if
    implemented, would, or as applied does (i) adversely affect the
    liquidity or efficiency of the market for government securities; or

    [t]he proper functioning of the securities industry and markets

    transparent disclosure.<br>
    Securities industry participation by persons with a history of
    fraudulent conduct is<br>
    antithetical to the protection of investors. . . . We have long held
    that a history of<br>
    egregious fraudulent conduct demonstrates unfitness for future
    participation in the<br>
    securities industry even if the disqualifying conduct is not related
    to the<br>
    professional capacity in which the respondent was acting when he or
    she engaged<br>
    in the misconduct underlying the proceeding. The industry relies on

    <br>
    (a) Whoever, with intent that another person engage in conduct
    constituting a felony that has as an element the use, attempted use,
    or threatened use of physical force against property or against the
    person of another in violation of the laws of the United States, and
    under circumstances strongly corroborative of that intent, solicits,
    commands, induces, or otherwise endeavours to persuade such other
    person to engage in such conduct, shall be imprisoned not more than
    one-half the maximum term of imprisonment or (notwithstanding
    section 3571) fined not more than one-half of the maximum fine
    prescribed for the punishment of the crime solicited, or both; or if
    the crime solicited is punishable by life imprisonment or death,

    (b) It is an affirmative defence to a prosecution under this section
    that, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete
    renunciation of his criminal intent, the defendant prevented the
    commission of the crime solicited. A renunciation is not "voluntary
    and complete" if it is motivated in whole or in part by a decision
    to postpone the commission of the crime until another time or to
    substitute another victim or another but similar objective. If the
    defendant raises the affirmative defence at trial, the defendant has
    the burden of proving the defence by a preponderance of the
    evidence.<br>
    =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 (c) It is not a defence to a prosecution under thi=
s section that
    the person solicited could not be convicted of the crime because he
    lacked the state of mind required for its commission, because he was
    incompetent or irresponsible, or because he is immune from
    prosecution or is not subject to prosecution.<br>

    to postpone the commission of the crime until another time or to
    substitute another victim or another but similar objective. If the

    evidence.<br>
    =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 (c) It is not a defence to a prosecution under thi=

    Thank you for understanding and responding to these unusual

    How do I go about insuring those assets of mine which have NOT been
    returned as of current? I will not pursue the FDIC for my money,
    however other may, as they have reported both vacancies and a growth
    +/- while considering the 10 years prior did represent YoY changes
    which do not represent a natural NNN-Lease, as those would be
    linear. About MY deposit: My Deposit is being held at a bank that

    States government. Since the FDIC began operations in 1934, no
    depositor has ever lost a penny of FDIC-insured deposits.<br>

    ### USC 18. =C2=A7208. Acts affecting a personal financial interest<b=
r>
    <br>
    <br>
    (a) Except as permitted by subsection (b) hereof, whoever, being an
    officer or employee of the executive branch of the United States
    Government, or of any independent agency of the United States, a
    Federal Reserve bank director, officer, or employee, or an officer
    or employee of the District of Columbia, including a special
    Government employee, participates personally and substantially as a
    Government officer or employee, through decision, approval,
    disapproval, recommendation, the rendering of advice, investigation,
    or otherwise, in a judicial or other proceeding, application,
    request for a ruling or other determination, contract, claim,
    controversy, charge, accusation, arrest, or other particular matter
    in which, to his knowledge, he, his spouse, minor child, general
    partner, organization in which he is serving as officer, director,
    trustee, general partner or employee, or any person or organization
    with whom he is negotiating or has any arrangement concerning
    prospective employment, has a financial interest-Shall be subject to
    the penalties set forth in section 216 of this title.<br>
    (b) Subsection (a) shall not apply-<br>
    (1) if the officer or employee first advises the Government official
    responsible for appointment to his or her position of the nature and
    circumstances of the judicial or other proceeding, application,
    request for a ruling or other determination, contract, claim,
    controversy, charge, accusation, arrest, or other particular matter
    and makes full disclosure of the financial interest and receives in
    advance a written determination made by such official that the
    interest is not so substantial as to be deemed likely to affect the
    integrity of the services which the Government may expect from such
    officer or employee;<br>
    (2) if, by regulation issued by the Director of the Office of
    Government Ethics, applicable to all or a portion of all officers
    and employees covered by this section, and published in the Federal
    Register, the financial interest has been exempted from the
    requirements of subsection (a) as being too remote or too
    inconsequential to affect the integrity of the services of the
    Government officers or employees to which such regulation applies;<br=
>
    (3) in the case of a special Government employee serving on an
    advisory committee within the meaning of the Federal Advisory
    Committee Act (including an individual being considered for an
    appointment to such a position), the official responsible for the
    employee's appointment, after review of the financial disclosure
    report filed by the individual pursuant to the Ethics in Government
    Act of 1978, certifies in writing that the need for the individual's
    services outweighs the potential for a conflict of interest created
    by the financial interest involved...<br>

    On June 23, 2014, Balboa was sentenced to a prison term of
    fortyeight months, to run concurrently on all counts, followed by
    three years of supervised release, and ordered to pay restitution of

    15 U.S. Code =C2=A7 78r - Liability for misleading statements<br>
    (a)Persons liable; persons entitled to recover; defense of good

    Any person who shall make or cause to be made any statement in any
    application, report, or document filed pursuant to this chapter or
    any rule or regulation thereunder or any undertaking contained in a
    registration statement as provided in subsection (d) of section 78o
    of this title, which statement was at the time and in the light of
    the circumstances under which it was made false or misleading with
    respect to any material fact, shall be liable to any person (not
    knowing that such statement was false or misleading) who, in
    reliance upon such statement, shall have purchased or sold a
    security at a price which was affected by such statement, for
    damages caused by such reliance, unless the person sued shall prove
    that he acted in good faith and had no knowledge that such statement
    was false or misleading. A person seeking to enforce such liability

    (5)The Commission shall consult with and consider the views of the
    Secretary of the Treasury prior to approving a proposed rule filed
    by a registered securities association that primarily concerns
    conduct related to transactions in government securities, except
    where the Commission determines that an emergency exists requiring
    expeditious or summary action and publishes its reasons therefor. If
    the Secretary of the Treasury comments in writing to the Commission
    on a proposed rule that has been published for comment, the
    Commission shall respond in writing to such written comment before
    approving the proposed rule. If the Secretary of the Treasury
    determines, and notifies the Commission, that such rule, if
    implemented, would, or as applied does (i) adversely affect the
    liquidity or efficiency of the market for government securities; or
    (ii) impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate
    in furtherance of the purposes of this section, the Commission
    shall, prior to adopting the proposed rule, find that such rule is
    necessary and appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this
    section notwithstanding the Secretary=E2=80=99s determination.<br>

    [t]he proper functioning of the securities industry and markets
    depends on the<br>
    integrity of industry participants and their commitment to
    transparent disclosure.<br>
    Securities industry participation by persons with a history of
    fraudulent conduct is<br>
    antithetical to the protection of investors. . . . We have long held
    that a history of<br>
    egregious fraudulent conduct demonstrates unfitness for future
    participation in the<br>
    securities industry even if the disqualifying conduct is not related
    to the<br>
    professional capacity in which the respondent was acting when he or
    she engaged<br>
    in the misconduct underlying the proceeding. The industry relies on
    the fairness<br>
    and integrity of all persons associated with each of the professions
    covered by the<br>
    collateral bar to forgo opportunities to defraud and abuse other
    market<br>

    The Commission is authorized to bring an action in the proper
    district court of the United States or United States court of<br>
    any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the
    United States, alleging that a person serving or acting in one or
    more of the following capacities has been guilty, after the
    enactment of this title and within five years of the commencement of
    the action, of gross misconduct or gross abuse of trust in respect
    of any registered investment company for which such person so serves
    or acts:<br>
    (1) as officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment
    adviser, or depositor; or<br>
    (2) as principal underwriter, if such registered company is an
    open-end company, unit investment trust, or face-amount<br>

    (b) It shall be unlawful for any person to make any untrue statement
    of a material fact in any registration statement, application,
    report, account, record, or other document filed or transmitted
    pursuant to this title or the keeping of which is required pursuant

    26 U.S. Code =C2=A7 6662 - Imposition of accuracy-related penalty on
    underpayments<br>
    <br>
    =C2=A7 1.6662-2 Accuracy-related penalty.<br>
    (a) In general. Section 6662(a) imposes an accuracy-related penalty
    on any portion of an underpayment of tax (as defined in section
    6664(a) and =C2=A7 1.6664-2) required to be shown on a return if such=

    portion is attributable to one or more of the following types of
    misconduct:<br>
    <br>
    (1) Negligence or disregard of rules or regulations (see =C2=A7
    1.6662-3);<br>
    <br>
    (2) Any substantial understatement of income tax (see =C2=A7 1.6662-4=
);
    or<br>
    <br>
    (3) Any substantial (or gross) valuation misstatement under chapter
    1 (=E2=80=9Csubstantial valuation misstatement=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9Cg=
ross valuation
    misstatement=E2=80=9D), provided the applicable dollar limitation set=
 forth
    in section 6662(e)(2) is satisfied (see =C2=A7 1.6662-5).<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    (b) Amount of penalty -<br>
    <br>
    (1) In general. The amount of the accuracy-related penalty is 20
    percent of the portion of an underpayment<br>
    of tax required to be shown on a return that is attributable to any
    of the types of misconduct listed in paragraphs<br>
    (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section, except as provided in
    paragraph (b)(2) of this section.<br>
    <br>
    (2) Increase in penalty for gross valuation misstatement.<br>
    In the case of a gross valuation misstatement, as defined in section
    6662(h)(2) and =C2=A7 1.6662-5(e)(2),<br>
    the amount of the accuracy-related penalty is 40 percent of the
    portion of an underpayment of tax required<br>
    to be shown on a return that is attributable to the gross valuation
    misstatement, provided the applicable<br>
    dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2) is satisfied.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    =C2=A7 1.6662-5 Substantial and gross valuation misstatements under
    chapter 1.<br>
    (a) In general. If any portion of an underpayment, as defined in
    section 6664(a) and<br>
    =C2=A7 1.6664-2, of any income tax imposed under chapter 1 of subtitl=
e A
    of the Code that is<br>
    required to be shown on a return is attributable to a substantial
    valuation misstatement<br>
    under chapter 1 (=E2=80=9Csubstantial valuation misstatement=E2=80=9D=
), there is
    added to the tax an amount equal to 20 percent of such portion.<br>
    <br>
    Section 6662(h) increases the penalty to 40 percent in the case of a
    gross valuation misstatement under chapter 1<br>
    (=E2=80=9Cgross valuation misstatement=E2=80=9D).<br>
    No penalty under section 6662(b)(3) is imposed, however, on a
    portion of an underpayment<br>
    that is attributable to a substantial or gross valuation
    misstatement unless the aggregate<br>
    of all portions of the underpayment attributable to substantial or
    gross valuation misstatements<br>
    exceeds the applicable dollar limitation ($5,000 or $10,000), as
    provided in section 6662(e)(2) and paragraphs<br>
    (b) and<br>
    (f)(2) of this section.<br>
    This penalty also does not apply to the extent that the reasonable
    cause and good faith exception to this penalty<br>
    set forth in =C2=A7 1.6664-4 applies. There is no disclosure exceptio=
n to
    this penalty.<br>
    <br>
    (b) Dollar limitation.<br>
    No penalty may be imposed under section 6662(b)(3) for a taxable
    year unless<br>
    <br>
    the portion of the underpayment for that year that is attributable
    to substantial or gross valuation misstatements exceeds $5,000<br>
    ($10,000 in the case of a corporation other than an S corporation
    (as defined in section 1361(a)(1));<br>
    <br>
    or a personal holding company (as defined in section 542)).<br>
    <br>
    This limitation is applied separately to each taxable year for which
    there is a substantial or gross valuation misstatement.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    (e) Definitions -<br>
    <br>
    (1) Substantial valuation misstatement.<br>
    There is a substantial valuation misstatement if the value or
    adjusted basis of any property claimed on a<br>
    return of tax imposed under chapter 1 is 200 percent or more of the
    correct amount.<br>
    <br>
    (2) Gross valuation misstatement.<br>
    There is a gross valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted
    basis of any property claimed on a return of tax<br>
    imposed under chapter 1 is 400 percent or more of the correct
    amount.<br>
    <br>
    (3) Property.<br>
    For purposes of this section, the term =E2=80=9Cproperty=E2=80=9D ref=
ers to both
    tangible and intangible property.<br>
    Tangible property includes property such as land, buildings,
    fixtures and inventory.<br>
    Intangible property includes property such as goodwill, covenants
    not to compete, leaseholds, patents,<br>
    contract rights, debts and choses in action.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    (f) Multiple valuation misstatements on a return -<br>
    <br>
    (1) Determination of whether valuation misstatements are substantial
    or gross.<br>
    The determination of whether there is a substantial or gross
    valuation misstatement on a return is<br>
    made on a property-by-property basis. Assume, for example, that
    property A has a value of 60 but a taxpayer claims a value of 110,<br=
>
    and that property B has a value of 40 but the taxpayer claims a
    value of 100.<br>
    <br>
    Because the claimed and correct values are compared on a
    property-by-property basis,<br>
    there is a substantial valuation misstatement with respect to
    property B, but not with respect to property A,<br>
    even though the claimed values (210) are 200 percent or more of the
    correct values (100) when compared on an aggregate basis.<br>
    <br>
    (2) Application of dollar limitation. For purposes of applying the
    dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2),<br>
    the determination of the portion of an underpayment that is
    attributable to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement<br>
    is made by aggregating all portions of the underpayment attributable
    to substantial or gross valuation misstatements.<br>
    <br>
    Assume, for example, that the value claimed for property C on a
    return is 250 percent of the correct value, and that the value
    claimed for property D on the return is 400 percent of the correct
    value.<br>
    Because the portions of an underpayment that are attributable to a
    substantial or gross valuation misstatement on a return are
    aggregated in applying the dollar limitation, the dollar limitation
    is satisfied if the portion of the underpayment that is attributable
    to the misstatement of the value of property C, when aggregated with
    the portion of the underpayment that is attributable to the
    misstatement of the value of property D, exceeds $5,000 ($10,000 in
    the case of most corporations).<br>
    <br>
    (g) Property with a value or adjusted basis of zero.<br>
    <br>
    The value or adjusted basis claimed on a return of any property with
    a correct value or adjusted basis of zero is considered to be 400
    percent or more of the correct amount. There is a gross valuation
    misstatement with respect to such property, therefore, and the
    applicable penalty rate is 40 percent.<br>

    (e) Definitions -<br>
    <br>
    (1) Substantial valuation misstatement.<br>
    There is a substantial valuation misstatement if the value or
    adjusted basis of any property claimed on a<br>
    return of tax imposed under chapter 1 is 200 percent or more of the
    correct amount.<br>
    <br>
    (2) Gross valuation misstatement.<br>
    There is a gross valuation misstatement if the value or adjusted
    basis of any property claimed on a return of tax<br>
    imposed under chapter 1 is 400 percent or more of the correct
    amount.<br>
    <br>
    (3) Property.<br>
    For purposes of this section, the term =E2=80=9Cproperty=E2=80=9D ref=

    Tangible property includes property such as land, buildings,

    (f) Multiple valuation misstatements on a return -<br>
    <br>
    (1) Determination of whether valuation misstatements are substantial
    or gross.<br>
    The determination of whether there is a substantial or gross
    valuation misstatement on a return is<br>
    made on a property-by-property basis. Assume, for example, that
    property A has a value of 60 but a taxpayer claims a value of 110,<br=
>
    and that property B has a value of 40 but the taxpayer claims a
    value of 100.<br>
    <br>
    Because the claimed and correct values are compared on a
    property-by-property basis,<br>
    there is a substantial valuation misstatement with respect to
    property B, but not with respect to property A,<br>
    even though the claimed values (210) are 200 percent or more of the
    correct values (100) when compared on an aggregate basis.<br>
    <br>
    (2) Application of dollar limitation. For purposes of applying the
    dollar limitation set forth in section 6662(e)(2),<br>
    the determination of the portion of an underpayment that is
    attributable to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement<br>
    is made by aggregating all portions of the underpayment attributable
    to substantial or gross valuation misstatements.<br>

    Assume, for example, that the value claimed for property C on a
    return is 250 percent of the correct value, and that the value
    claimed for property D on the return is 400 percent of the correct
    value.<br>
    Because the portions of an underpayment that are attributable to a
    substantial or gross valuation misstatement on a return are
    aggregated in applying the dollar limitation, the dollar limitation
    is satisfied if the portion of the underpayment that is attributable
    to the misstatement of the value of property C, when aggregated with
    the portion of the underpayment that is attributable to the
    misstatement of the value of property D, exceeds $5,000 ($10,000 in

    The value or adjusted basis claimed on a return of any property with
    a correct value or adjusted basis of zero is considered to be 400
    percent or more of the correct amount. There is a gross valuation
    misstatement with respect to such property, therefore, and the
    applicable penalty rate is 40 percent.<br>

    (5)The Commission shall consult with and consider the views of the
    Secretary of the Treasury prior to approving a proposed rule filed
    by a registered securities association that primarily concerns
    conduct related to transactions in government securities, except
    where the Commission determines that an emergency exists requiring
    expeditious or summary action and publishes its reasons therefor. If
    the Secretary of the Treasury comments in writing to the Commission
    on a proposed rule that has been published for comment, the
    Commission shall respond in writing to such written comment before
    approving the proposed rule. If the Secretary of the Treasury
    determines, and notifies the Commission, that such rule, if
    implemented, would, or as applied does (i) adversely affect the
    liquidity or efficiency of the market for government securities; or
    (ii) impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate

    [t]he proper functioning of the securities industry and markets

    integrity of industry participants and their commitment to
    transparent disclosure.<br>
    Securities industry participation by persons with a history of
    fraudulent conduct is<br>
    antithetical to the protection of investors. . . . We have long held
    that a history of<br>
    egregious fraudulent conduct demonstrates unfitness for future
    participation in the<br>
    securities industry even if the disqualifying conduct is not related
    to the<br>
    professional capacity in which the respondent was acting when he or
    she engaged<br>
    in the misconduct underlying the proceeding. The industry relies on

    the action, of gross misconduct or gross abuse of trust in respect
    of any registered investment company for which such person so serves

    USC 18, =C2=A7 373 - Solicitation to commit a crime of violence<br>
    <br>
    (a) Whoever, with intent that another person engage in conduct
    constituting a felony that has as an element the use, attempted use,
    or threatened use of physical force against property or against the
    person of another in violation of the laws of the United States, and
    under circumstances strongly corroborative of that intent, solicits,
    commands, induces, or otherwise endeavours to persuade such other
    person to engage in such conduct, shall be imprisoned not more than
    one-half the maximum term of imprisonment or (notwithstanding
    section 3571) fined not more than one-half of the maximum fine
    prescribed for the punishment of the crime solicited, or both; or if
    the crime solicited is punishable by life imprisonment or death,

    (b) It is an affirmative defence to a prosecution under this section
    that, under circumstances manifesting a voluntary and complete
    renunciation of his criminal intent, the defendant prevented the
    commission of the crime solicited. A renunciation is not "voluntary
    and complete" if it is motivated in whole or in part by a decision
    to postpone the commission of the crime until another time or to
    substitute another victim or another but similar objective. If the
    defendant raises the affirmative defence at trial, the defendant has
    the burden of proving the defence by a preponderance of the
    evidence.<br>
    =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 (c) It is not a defence to a prosecution under thi=
s section that
    the person solicited could not be convicted of the crime because he
    lacked the state of mind required for its commission, because he was
    incompetent or irresponsible, or because he is immune from
    prosecution or is not subject to prosecution.<br>

    and complete" if it is motivated in whole or in part by a decision
    to postpone the commission of the crime until another time or to
    substitute another victim or another but similar objective. If the

    the burden of proving the defence by a preponderance of the
    evidence.<br>
    =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 (c) It is not a defence to a prosecution under thi=
