  SEC. 17.  for willful misfeasance. SEC. 17.

## Liability of directors, etc., for willful misfeasance. SEC. 17.
(h)     After one year from the effective date of this title, neither
the charter, certificate of incorporation, articles of association, 
indenture of trust, nor the by-laws of any registered investment 
company, nor any other instrument pursuant to which such a company is 
organized or administered, shall contain any provision which protects or 
purports to protect any director or officer of such company against any 
liability to the company or to its security holders to which he would 
otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross 
negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct 
of his office.

In the event that any such instrument does not at the effective date of 
this Act comply with the requirements of this subsection (h) and is not 
amended to comply therewith prior to the expiration of said one year, 
such company may nevertheless continue to be a registered investment 
company and shall not be deemed to violate this subsection if prior to 
said expiration date each such director or officer shall have filed with 
the Commission a waiver in writing of any protective provision of the 
instrument to the extent that it does not comply with this subsection, 
and each such person subsequently elected or appointed shall before 
assuming office file a similar waiver.

(i)     After one year from the effective date of this title no contract 
or agreement under which any person undertakes to act as investment 
adviser of, or principal underwriter for, a registered investment 
company shall contain any provision which protects or purports to 
protect such person against any liability to such company or its 
security holders to which he would otherwise be subject by reason of 
willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence, in the performance 
of his duties, or by reason of his reckless disregard of his obligations 
and duties under such contract or agreement.

## Injunctions against gross abuse. SEC. 36.
The Commission is authorized to bring an action in the proper district 
court of the United States or United States court of
any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United 
States, alleging that a person serving or acting in one or more of the 
following capacities has been guilty, after the enactment of this title 
and within five years of the commencement of the action, of gross 
misconduct or gross abuse of trust in respect of any registered 
investment company for which such person so serves or acts:
(1) as officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment 
adviser, or depositor; or
(2) as principal underwriter, if such registered company is an open-end 
company, unit investment trust, or face-amount
certificate company.



DESTRUCTION AND FALSIFICATION OF REPORTS AND RECORDS
SEC. 34.

(a) It shall be unlawful for any person, except as permitted by rule, 
regulation, or order of the Commission, willfully to
destroy, mutilate, or alter any account, book, or other document the 
preservation of which has been required pursuant to section 31 (a) or 32 
(c).
(b) It shall be unlawful for any person to make any untrue statement of 
a material fact in any registration statement, application, report, 
account, record, or other document filed or transmitted pursuant to this 
title or the keeping of which is required pursuant to section 31 (a).

It shall be unlawful for any person so filing, transmitting, or keeping 
any such document to omit to state therein any fact necessary in order 
to prevent the statements made therein, in the light of the 
circumstances under which they were made, from being materially 
misleading. For the purposes of this subsection, any part of any such 
document which is signed or certified by an accountant or auditor in his 
capacity as such shall be deemed to be made, filed, transmitted, or kept 
by such accountant or auditor, as well as by the person filing, 
transmitting, or keeping the complete document.
